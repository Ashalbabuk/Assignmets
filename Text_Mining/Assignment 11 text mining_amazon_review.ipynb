       " \"\\n\\n  OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment.Pros.Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ...1. screen looks great2. Camera works descently but after some struggle3. Warp charge4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking5.screen brightnessCons.1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience.2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate.3. Mono speakerIt's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass.4.ufs 2.1The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it..I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool.If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again.This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance..OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment.It's just a midranger phone in the end.For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlusHope this helps ...thanks\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6.But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation.I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days.\\n\\n\",\n",

I got it on 2nd August and after more than 24 hours of use i can say my decision and wait was all worth it.Phone is great. One plus is indeed flagship killer, its manufared by oppo india, and i have serious piece of advice for people who are considering buyingOppo Reno 4Dont waste your money there instead get nord, i have seen for years how oppo charges atleast 10K premium for devices that have even year old processors. You can get SD765 instead of SD720 and even nord's top varient costs 5k less than 'Reno Shit'.And those considering Realme X3 pro zoom there's nothing special about it except for the fact that you wanna buy go with SD855 only you can seriously consider buying Nord coz apart for SD855 nord is better in every department and you don't realise any difference whether its day today tasks or heavy gaming.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Expected a lot, now struggling to justify myself..!! Obliviously pre-ordered  and got it on 4th Aug. Keeping all the hypes aside, its a decent phone with all the latest features and an average performance in most of the areas. Camera doesn't sound to be bad as like most of us heard on the initial reviews. Its in fact truly awesome, but few distortions in low light and indoor clicks. Also no tint issue so far for me which has been widely reported. We will definitely going to miss the Ear phone jack and memory card slot in this new Oneplus Nord. Obviously its a genuine 5G phone though India yet to upgraded to that level.As per me, below are key challenges which i am experiencing currently with this Nord.  1) Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate  2) Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength  3) Nord is not a good option for gamer's  4) Battery performance is absolutely average, but 30 W Warp Charge power adapter is a blessingHope Oneplus will soon come up with some software upgrades and reduce the impact due to the above challenges for their users.If you are not looking for a high performing flagship mobile, Nord could be a King and satisfies you in all the aspects. Still its a Mid-rage King..!!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Camera:selfi camera is great. back camera is medium quality not great like 8 pro. I tried gcam in this mobile, image quality increases.Performance:Blazing fast like SD 865. There is no difference noted in using daily usage. You only Notice difference in heavy gaming and heavy tasks from 765g and 865 processors.Speaker:Its is loud enough and does its job for its price for 28000 of phone. Dont expect like flagship speakers. if u put volume below 50%, volume of speaker is low and increase the volume above 50%, then speaker volume increases suddenly. At 100% volume, sound comes with some noise.Battery:i got SOT of 6 hrs with 90hz. battery losts easily for one day. When using camera battery drain faster.Display:great display like 7t. blacks are deep. No tint issues in display. colours are accurate. viewing angles are great. All google apps in dark mode are in grey colour(this is not a tint issue). So dont decide tint issue with google apps. Use dark wallpaper and then decide ur tint issueVerdict:If you are a Heavy Gamer(Only with ultra high gaming settings is not suitable but suites for lite gamers) and Camera centric user this mobile is not for u. Apart from camera and speaker, it is great phone. Mainly VALUE FOR MONEY.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  It was a big jump for me from budget phone to One plus Nord! I was skeptical before buying such high price phone and that too without any discount (I bought during Amzon pre-order period, as it has to be gifted to my wife, 8/128 INR 27999/-).  But after I open the pack I felt relived. Build quality is superb and feels solid. Photo quality is plus plus...I took some photos in dark and they were crisp and clear. Colours of photos looks natural and attractive!I never looked so handsome before :-) I need more time to explore all pro features.Overall all are plus plus as of now!

You cant even exchange this phone anywhere(literally nowhere, try it before you buy) and no one would by this as second hand phone.\\n\\n',\n",

I purchased phone in 28000rs now what should I do\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  An absolute wastage of money. The product worked fine for initial 6 days, later faced issues like battery draining, mobile heating, mobile lagging, when I tried to replace it, the return window was closed. I tried to contact the seller, 3 emails and the seller has not bothered to reply to a single email.So I visited the OnePlus store where I was told that certain 3rd party apps cause bugs and lead to battery drainage or lagging issues and I should wait for further updates from the applications so that the OnePlus software can then be compatible.Speaking about the camera, front camera is terrible, it resembles front camera of smartphones like Oppo, Vivo. Sharpness is too high for the camera. Utter waste!Overall, I would suggest don't fall or get fooled for the OnePlus flagship because launching something for 26/28/30k only because you gained a lot of popularity is pathetic. There are many other good smartphones in the similar range that are performing pretty well than the Nord phone. OnePlus Nord has been a total disappointment and a poor purchase leading to wastage of money.\\n\\n\",\n",

I know it's not that great but it's not that bad either. People are paying half the price of one plus flagships and expect the same quality(though both 1+8 and nord have the same primary camera.lol). Of course they are gonna bring improvements but  it's not going to exceed some people's expectations.3)Battery life:- It's not that great.

       " \"\\n\\n  So I suppose I'm the first one to receive this beast from Amazon. Arrived damn early then expected!!!!Talking about phone-Display- 90hz fluid amoled display is amazing. Just can't resist to use for a longer time. 5/5Processor- Since there was lot of hype for this new SD765G which supports 5G. I'll put it this way that it supports intensive gaming as well. Played pubg and there is no lag at all and opens game in a flash. There is gaming mode for gamers. Handles everything very smoothly. 5/5Camera- Haven't tested a lot yet. Though main camera is good. Same as OP8. But other camera are not that great as one might think. They work good though and at this price you can't argue for more. It has wide angle and that is good as well. Nightmode haven't used till now. Will post that as well once I'll test that. 4/5Battery- Till now it's awesome. 4115mAh battery is sufficient for a day's work. If we include gaming you might want to charge twice a day. But again that's ok. So bang on! 5/5Charging- 30T wrap charging.. it quite fast!! 5/5UI- Who wants anything else if you get oxygen OS. Best in class and superior factor to consider OP phones. It classy. No BS at all. Authentic OP design.  5/5Design and build- Nice build, fits perfectly in hand. Gorilla glass in front and back just plastic in side and that's not an issue in anyway!! 5/5Overall it's a powerful package from OP.. I would say worth the hype!!!!Go for any color you like.. I preferred grey onyx.Box included OnePlus nord, RCC card, high quality transparent case. Case is literally very good. I just want one more case in case I need in future :p 2 yrs of confirmed OS upadte. And moreover there was already an OTA update when you switch on the device for camera and other bug fixes.Amazing work by OP!! Just awaiting for pre-order gift vouchers now!!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Okay. So, firstly, horrible delivery by Amazon india. I placed the order on 30th July. It got shipped on 12th August and was delivered by 16th. This review will be completely unbiased and will come from an user who used vivo v15 pro beforehand.Like all of you, I also believed that Nord did not live up to the hype by seeing it get criticised by reviewers. But, trust me, this midranger gives you the same premium feeling as you would expect in a flagship device. (Not joking, it's beautiful). Obviously if you come from a device like OnePlus 6,7,8 it's a downgrade, no doubt. I wanted to buy the 7t for it's features and processor, but I bought the Nord. Why ?1) 10k cheaper than 7t.2) Better selfie camera composition.3) Same bloatware free oxygenOS.4) 90Hz fluid AMOLED display. (trust me guys, it's buttery smooth. I found it brighter than my vivo and way smoother due to the 90Hz panel. You will get addicted to the display).5) sd 765g : Day to day tasks like swiping , moving through apps is as fluid as found on higher premium OnePlus devices. (I compared the swiping speeds with 7t pro, it could catch up with the 7t pro). I'm not a heavy gamer. I usually keep my gaming sessions short like for 10 mins at a stretch and I'm done. I noticed zero frame drops playing COD, it ran very smooth. No lags.5) Build quality : I don't know why so much people are making a fuss over the plastic frame. I used an unibody cheap plastic built v15 pro and coming from that, the NORD felt VERY premium in my hands. It is really compact, inhand feel is awesome. You can feel it's a premium device when you hold it. Stop believing crap like the phone feels less premium due to it's plastic frame. We wouldn't even know it was plastic unless it was clarified by OnePlus.6) User interface: Coming from a trash funtouchOS, the oxygenOS is heavenly. It runs apps very smoothly and really fast. No complaints.7) I don't know how many people would want to know but the ultrawide angle selfie cam is pretty useful. It helps.8) Super linear bottom firing mono speaker: The speaker has way more better clarity and loudness than my v15 pro. Yes, it's definitely not loud as the 7t /8/7t pro. But it's loud enough. Would not complain.Here's what I do miss tho:-1) I really miss the headphone jack. I don't have money to buy TWS rn. So I do, dearly miss the headphone jack.2) I expected ufs 3.0 storage. But 2.1 is okay, you wouldn't notice if you aren't that nitpicky.3) The camera quality I would say , for an all-arounder star device like the Nord, it's okayish. It gives you really good day light pictures with decent details. It won't disappoint you in any aspect if daylight pictures are concerned. The pictures look natural, not artificially boosted and punched like vivo phones. The ultra wide sensor gives you really good colors and you won't really find any difference until you zoom into that picture for details. I could get very good(if not the best) portrait shots and the macro camera, well it's useless. Don't use it. Overall, I know OnePlus will definitely improve the camera on this through regular software updates.4) unpopular opinion : Even if a premium phone with better cameras and a flagship processor comes out in the market, I would prefer oxygenOS rather than choosing any of the realme, miuis,etc .\\n\\n\",\n",

Would have loved a headphone jack instead of some of the camera (only the primary rear camera is good) . Accessories are all good. Tried out the cameras with gcam mod and the results are comparable to a pixel phone (well oneplus gave decent primary front and rear camera hardware but software is bad).

I took it to the service center and I was told that this is a manufacturing defect and will be replaced in 10 days. I  submitted my device to the service center on 17th of August. Meanwhile when I tried to track the replacement, I tried to reach out to OnePlus Customer Support via email, chat service and call. I was unable to get any response regarding replacement after 15 emails, 10 calls and 10 interactions with the chat service to escalate the issue to a higher authority in the company. On September 3rd (after 17 days) I received replacement but I was not given any acknowledgment for the replacement. It turned out that the replacement was also defective with display issues. Now they are not even responding to me regarding replacement of 2nd defect device. One of the worst customer support services on this planet Earth. Buyers beware and proceed with caution.

Primary reason for purchasing NORD is for camera spec and advertised as \"Copied from Onplus8\",but failed to impress.  I think camera is borrowed from Budget phone, \"DEFINITELY NOT FROM ONEPLUS 8\".Quality is same as Expected sharpness in image. Image is blurred while zooming. Image quality is at par with Redmi Note3.2.Sound Quality is borrowed from cheap china mobile. Not expected from ONEPLUS.3.

       " \"\\n\\n  I bought 8gb ram variant.  let's talk about pros ans cons -1. Battery life - battery drains too fast. However it has fast charging as well. But you need to charge your phone very often. For 100% battery it last up to 7 hours on screen. That's pretty low when you are into phone all time2. Front camera - picture quality is average. Not that great. Biggest drawback is after clicking selfie you need to be still for atleast 2-3 seconds. There's a lag between when you click pic and when it captures your image. And that's really annoying. Another major drawback poor quality in low light.3. Back/Rear Camera. Picture quality is good, also in dim light.4. Gaming - pubg. It runs smooth with graphics5. Fingerprint. - i am first time using on screen finger print and i am not liking it at all. Again it takes seconds to response. Arrgghh... annoying when you are in hurry.All over, better go for flagship phone. It is not worth spending money. I feel like i can get same features or better features in some other brand in lesser price.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I've been following this phone to buy ever since they started the project hoping it would be good...WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT..1. A Flagship level gaming performance2. A Flagship Quality camera3. That it will be super easy living without 3.5mm because I still find it a bit difficult to get used to(but it's a worthy trade-off)WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT...1.  A Flagship quality performance in terms of day to day usage because the bloatfree OxygenOS makes sure you do2. A beautiful Display with a must have refresh rate3. All day battery with proper fast charge...( A lot of people might be expecting a better battery life but if you are using 90hz it will be like this no matter which company you use )4. I meant proper because most of the phones get hot while fast charging but this didn'tOverall It is a phone which is a perfect daily driver with a good gaming performance and If you believe a phone is more than what the spec sheet says then this is for you.P.S. Disappointed with Amazon delivery...Preordered phone took 10 days after shipping to get delivered after shipping while an usual order takes 3 days.\\n\\n\",\n",

My oneplus 3T display looks much better compared to the Nord. The replacement is processed by Amazon as they verify issue by arranging technician visit to examine my device first. It's really a big disappointment..Thanks to Amazon for looking into my issue .. I suggest ppl to reconsider before buying.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  My Nord was delivered on 2nd August. After a week, these are my reviews.Pros1)  Fluid AMOLED Display and 90 Hz display rate gives the display exactly what your eyes need for a soothing experience (did not experience the tint issue yet).2)  After using Redmi Note 5 Pro for more than 2 years (the advertisements are hell), the Oxygen OS feels heavenly.3)  I bought the Gray Onyx version. It looks really premium.4)  The mobile is really fast and smooth.5)  You will be genuinely impressed with the face unlock speed with this mobile. The fingerprint scanner was also fairly fast (I really liked the various ways you could customize fingerprint unlock animations; the cosmos one is pure love).6)  My mom has Oppo A5 2020, and this mobile is smaller than that one. This set feels surprisingly handy (which really goes with the lightweight build of this mobile).7)  This is my first OnePlus, so the charging cable and the adapter really impressed me. (Charging speed results done by me when the mobile was switched off and was at 0% : 50% at 24 minutes, 61% at 30 minutes (9% short of their claim), 80% at 41 minutes, 100% at 58 minutes).8)  Again, my first OP, so the Alert slider impressed me as well.9)  Not a pro gamer, but this mobile has a FNATIC mode for games. Yet to test what it actually does, but my gaming experience was fairly good.10)  The zen mode. I liked this touch a lot. Reminds us that there is a life outside of your mobile too (go talk with your family and have a nice chat with them).11)  The reading mode. Again, another thing I liked (pardon me if these are common features in mobiles of this range). I read a lot, and I don't like ebooks much. But even when you are scrolling down Google learning about the life cycle or genetic composition of the Coronavirus, the black and white mode feels soothing to the eye.Neutral1)  For camera, which I know is a prime requirement for many, please look into other reviews. I am not a voracious camera user, so my views on this would be unfair to you readers. The only review I can give is that, in low light, while taking a photo, if your hand shakes, the picture comes a little hazy.Cons1)  Battery. Yes. Many people in the OnePlus community have raised this issue as well. I will just write down my issues. If you use the mobile normally, the mobile should go on for a day (that is, you will have to charge it once a day). Even if you play games, the battery tries to handle itself, and I would call that performance average.However, if you switch on Hotspot, battery drains like a flowing river downhill a mountain. I have some tasks that I do in the laptop, and I do not have a ethernet connection, so this is an issue for me. Kindly keep this in mind.2)  You knew this was coming. The 3.5 mm jack that everyone loves.3)  Although the speaker is loud, stereo speakers would have been better.4)  Not an issue for me, but yes, you can get better processors at this price (Realme X2 pro, for example).5)  Again, not an issue for me, but no SD card support. (The lack of SD card support and 3.5 mm jack is becoming prevalent, it seems).6)  I wish the frame wasn't of plastic, but it is (Although the buttons are of metal).ConclusionI can not emphasize much how much I am liking this mobile. If you like watching anime, movies, or even youtube, the screen will feel like a bliss.Among the 6 cons I have written, I can still live with 5 of them, but the battery draining issue is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. My Redmi Note 5 Pro handled being a Hotspot better than this mobile. I don't know if it is possible to fix this by an OTA update.I sincerely request all users of OP Nord to check their battery backup. You can comment below if you want to.Note: All of these are personal reviews. Thank you for reading quite a long review. You won't regret buying this, that is for sure.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Never thought OnePlus brand can degrade this low on camera quality. You will definitely be disappointed with the performance of both front and rear cameras. Instead of 2 at the front and 4 at the rear they should have given atleast on proper camera to do the job. Disappointed..why oneplus why...\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  First let me clarify this: \"Nord does not have any disturbing tinge issues as hyped by the media\" A very slight purple color appears when you use it in dark with lowest brightness and that too looks good instead of disturbing. And I am pretty certain that I will not be using that setting ever!Overall the product is really good. The build of the phone is very premium. Main camera, selfie cameras are very good. Macro is a waste, though. You can take better macro shots from the main camera itself. I am not too fond of photography so I don\\'t bother with it\\'s presence/absence.Oxyzen OS as always is ❤️. 90hz display, battery, warp charge makes it a very good product.Will recommend to buy this phone. Missing headphone jack might bother you if you are not using blutooth earphones but I am okay with it.Overall impression: Good phone if you get it for 25k (8GB ram variant)\\n\\n',\n",

No connectivity issue.✓ No heating issue noticed during use.✓ 30 W Warp charger. Charging speed similar to OP 8 Pro.✓ Fingerprint scanner is very fast.Cons :✓ Minor Display issue. A negotiable bar is visible towards front camera on extreme low light conditions or zero brightness condition.(Not lucky 2nd time. After received a perfect OP 8 Pro with no display issue). Hope it will solve by software update as OnePlus already mentioned it in their community page.✓ Need improvement in low light photography on front camera.✓ All 4 side pannel were made by plastice meterial, so there will be a chance of some scratches in future if u use a case on it. Noticed some lines on the top side of the phone after applying creator case.✓No Dolby Atmos.✓No 3.5 mm jack.## One updated feature in Oneplus Launcher setting i noticed in Nord, that is still missing on my OP 8 Pro...\\n\\n',\n",

Despite being mono speakey, the sound it much louder. And above all 90hz refresh rate with oxygen OS is a total bliss and no other android will give you this heavenly experience. The battery is draining a little quick but I think it's because of 90hz and maybe battery optimization will be done in future OTA updates.

Only on daylighting the back primary camera can take good pics, all the other cameras are useless in the back. Wide-angle lens shoots really soft pictures, you cant zoom or crop the picture or it turns grainy. Depth and macro are just place holders. They are of no good use.2. Performance is okayish, you won't feel any lag in normal usage, but scrolling through twitter feed or google news feels starts showing lags and jerks. Camera after clicking the picture ( after shutter sound, and a small image showing at the lower corner ), it still needs 1 more second to click the picture properly. you need to keep the camera in the same position even after clicking the pic for 1 more second or the pictures are blurry.3. Speaker is not good, high in volume but low in clarity, if you push the volume for more than 60% it starts cracking.4. Battery performance is not good either, it requires another round of charging by 8 PM ( without gaming) but my phone is defective and has some charging issue, not sure whether the battery performance is because of the same, waiting for a replacement .If you are ready to spend 28-30k and you really want OnePlus device and are ready to sacrifice with the sub-par camera setup, then go ahead else try to look out for other devices.\\n\\n\",\n",

There is no 3.5 Jack so u have to buy Bluetooth earphone, and Bluetooth is not working at all. It's not detecting oneplus earphones and if it's connected it will disconnect in few minutes. Go and search on Google u will get lots of topic regarding this.2. Phone music quality is too bad on every earphone.3. Phone doesn't have SD card support, so you can't take any backup directly to external memory. What was happened to me and I lots approx 300+ contacts and huge amount of photos.4. The mobile software has huge bugs and I am damn sure it was not tested properly.5. Mobile has plastic body, seriously for what I paid this much amount. Backside Chinese logo?6.

       " \"\\n\\n  This might help someone and save their money.1. Don't decide to buy a phone on crapy paid YouTube reviews (think if they are given review unit, those will be absolutely well quality checked and enhanced ones, no company give crapy defective product to review and take down their own reputation) only who spent money and bought to review them they review that product genuinely.2. Don't fall for so called company logo or crappy watermarks on pictures they captured ( which seems cool as every owner thinks, which actually not), they aren't worth your money.3. Don't rush and take newly launched phones, always see user reviews and buy.4. BEWARE OF FANBOYS. yes, this is important. As many of my friends have this company product, they feel themselves as brand ambassadors, they think their mobile company is superior supreme.. just because they have spent more money for after all a Chinese product, now because crapy Chinese product. Don't listen to those Fanboys, after all they are not your pocket but you are going to spend for it. Choose what makes you happy, even 10k mobiles aren't bad. You decide your mobile product not those product advertising people in your friend group.Now I tell my review about the unit I got:Pros:1. Slim sleek design2. Good OS3. Wide diplay4. Charging speed, charged to 100% within 40 min5. Handy6. Haptic touch is very responsive7. Good back cover8. No lagsCons:1. Camera:Camera is not at all feels like OnePlus camera (as I used many OnePlus phone's pictures of my friends). Though it has same camera specs of 7t and 8,8 pro (main camera I am referring to) it doesn't click photos like them. I feel my iPhone SE (2016 model) takes better natural pictures than this. Poor low light pictures, grainy, and photos become filter applied at 2x at low light. Depth sensor won't detect edges properly. Marco is waste, main camera colours are over contrasted. Front camera takes beautified pics even we don't use any filters, not at all natural pics, my iPhone SE old model's 1.3 mp takes more natural skin tones than this camera, it's like oppo beautified camera, wide angle camera is good.2. Display:Pink tint issue was present. More visible in Google apps. There was black bar visible extending from front camera notch hole, which was so irritating. It was visible in dark room, in dark theme, brightness below 10 percent.In light theme I could see screen fluctuations even though auto brightness is off.90hz is just a gimmick, battery drains fast at 90hz. So when I changed it to 60hz to save some battery, it is so yuck, lags are more, works like 2gb ram android phone. Since I came from using my iPhone SE old model at 60hz which is way butter smooth even after using it for 3.5 years, this nord disappointed me.3. Build quality:I got unit which had minor dent at its right corner.4. OSGood. Found some bugs like revert of settings to default after theme is changed. So u need to change those every time u change the theme, so irritating.Final opinion:I returned this product, Amazon service was great. 28k is not worthy for average processor, bad camera, average os, average build quality, average infact bad display. If you buy this thinking camera is good , you are fooled. Instead take 7t or realme x2 pro or k20 pro or Samsung m51 or a51, they won't disappoint you. Think wisely, don't fall for false useless advertisement gimmicks.Hope this helps you. Thank you, have a great day.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Well let's talk about the Features and performance of the phone first of all I Pre ordered this phone and it is my first OnePlus device I am using it and the best thing I like in this phone is that the OxygenOs which is buttery smooth and no lag and I was testing this device since 1 week and the over-all performance of this phone is very good only processor is a bit less like we should expect a flagship processor like Snapdragon 855 but in terms of pricing they choose 765g with 5g ready for future proof , let's talk about the camera quality well I was testing the camera and it is lit trust me the colors and pixels are bright and good like daylight pictures are just fabulous! For the gaming I don't find any lag issues or heating issues And the 1080p recording is just smooth and stable I have tested the stability of the video and it is superb. Let's talk about the display now - this amoled display is awesome and 90hz screen refresh rate makes everything buttery in terms of scrolling up and down! And the haptic feedback is also great while typing.. let's talk about some Cons- Could have go for Snapdragon 855 , Plastic frame doesn't make this phone premium , no headphone jack.Overall I would rate this phone 9.5 out of 10. :)\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  After reading other reviews, I think most of the people here were looking for a flagship phone for a 28-30k price tag. For me, I've been upgrading my phone almost every couple of years and that too from flagship to flagship. I got Nord after 6T and there's a huge difference in both phones, I'll mention my pros and cons :-Pros-•OnePlus is a company that listens to it's customers, there were minor bugs in the software which were fixed in an update I got after using the phone for a week.•The Oxygen OS feels fast (compared to 6T) paired with 90hz display and Snd765G, people there are 4 memory channel instead of 2 which is usually the case in Snd845 and travelling speed varies due to that.•The phone looks and feel premium as promised, you wouldn't even feel the plastic body and unless you're super strong or a rough user, don't buy this phone. (Remember a time when almost every phone was made of plastic)•The display is a lot better than OP 6T even though on paper they've the same display the color density per ppi is higher in Nord (One of the underrated feature for OP 2020 phones)•The phone is made in India even though the company is Chinese it is still employing people in India and if you're not a target of 25% increased unemployment rate, lucky you.•The Software is as fresh as it can get and I can't already wait for November to get Always-on-Display and Android 11.Cons-•The camera is performing great but I'm sure it's not flagship performance, instead of complaining I can wait for updates and as you can see in pixel series, software of the camera matters too.•After a week of usage I feel the battery is same as the 6T but as mentioned above Android 11 would most probably fix that.That's it for me, I think most bad reviews here are unjustified and doesn't give the a fair review to the phone. People using MI or Poco or Vivo or whatever, I don't think there's any company that listens to it's customers like OnePlus does. (Even Samsung can't move Brisby button even though everyone hates it) Look online and look for OP ideas website, the company genuinely cares about it's customer unlike most companies. Here you're paying for an almost flagship experience and the company delivers it exceptionally well. Hope my Review was helpful and it helps you enjoy your new phone\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The phone is amazing in terms of experience, customisation, battery life and camera quality - yes, the rumours about camera quality isn't true and I'm very happy with it. However, the seller and Amazon showed a special reviewers edition on my order that I never received. Even after complaining to Amazon customer care, I was asked to contact seller and seller forwarded my query to Amazon, hence passing the buck! Not a great experience!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Amazon is clearly cheating through the HDFC cash back bonus offer. They mentioned if the total bill amount is more than 30k then there will be a discount of 1750/- and a bonus cashback of 1250/-. However spite of my order size being more than 30k they are not giving the cashback, saying that because with the discount of 1750/- the total amount was less than 30k so we cannot pay the cashback of 1250/-. It clearly means that the bonus was applicable for bill amount of 31750/- and not 30000/- (similar situation would have been of bonus cash back above 1lac, where they were giving 5k of cashback).This is clear case of cheating/confusing the buyer. Although the phone product is very good\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Too many bugs in the software. Even making a basic phone call or receiving a phone call is nit error free! The basic utility of the phone itself has gone missing.The screen issue is existing, it's not noticeable in daily use. Only if you look for it you'll find it. Nevertheless, shouldn't be existing to an extent where normal usage is hindered by it. By far the worst iteration of phone by oneplus. Maybe the x was close to this in being bad.6 cameras, but not even one can produce decent results. They saybits the same module as OP8 but why is the result so bad from the main sensor? Looks like, they are wantedly degarding the performance to sell OP8 as well?90hz is present, but not certainly sure if it helps! As battery drains and have noticed couple if times, the phone phone hearts up! (After a week if usage, given that initial battery cycles might lead to extra heart dissipation) The peak brightness of my 5t is higher than Nord!All in all, look somewhere else. Not the right time to buy, maybe few issues might be fixed with OTA software updates. But there many hardware issues on this like the screen, battery and maybe the calling network issues!So, for time being stay away! Will update the review in future is OTA updates solve them!\\n\\n\",\n",

So the best option would be 8GB or 12 variant.#Please use a good mobile case as the frame is made up of plastic, which has high chances of getting damaged and it is not waterproof and dust proof certified.#Gamers should not consider this phone as the battery drains out quickly and there is also heating issue.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  This is going to be a big review, and is not about detailed specs that you can find anywhere online. This is a completely user review. So I have been using this phone for a week now, and here are my observations:1. An extremely well-built, solid hardware-software, very refined and polished. You will like every moment of using it.2. The display is awesome, almost at par with Samsung\\'s super-amoled displays. Videos in Youtube, Netflix, etc. are super clear, have high contrast and colours, and super quality.3. A 3.5mm jack is sorely missed. You ned to buy a separate type C to 3.5mm for the headphone. You need to click the mic button for the mic to work. The mic also doesn\\'t work with many earphones, and those without the button may not work at all. But the phone\\'s built-in mic will be used and the sound output is via the earphone. I need to research more into this. Bluetooth headphones work great though. I am using a cheap Rs.100 converter, and the sound output through my Sony/AKH/Boat earphones are mindblowing. No loss in sound quality. Very high bass. It becomes higher when you turn on \"Bass bosst\" in the equaliser settings.4. Sound output through the speakers is awesome too. It does not produce the tin-can sound that most phones produce. The sound output is really good even for small things like notification alert and ringtones, and whatsapp messages.5. The camera is absolutely fantastic. It produces crisp, real colour images with high detail in both front and rear cameras. I am a very long time user of Samsung flagship phones, and the only good cameras are above Rs.60k phones. But still they produce unrealistic high contrast software boosted images that look great, but not realistic. The Nord\\'s camera is the best I have seen in any phone, even better than Iphones.6. The battery is incredible too. Again coming from Samsung flagships, I never remembered the time I actually charged the phones more than 20 minutes, and had more than a day\\'s worth of power. The Nord is better than that. I charge my phone to 75% in the morning, and then connect to laptop (wifi hotspot) for around 8 hours, listen to music, watch videos, an hour of calls, and continuous whatsapp Skype use, and the battery still shows 30-35% next morning.7. Following the above point, yes I have a couple of habits, and always use dark themes, kill all apps every single time before locking my phone, have turned off all notificaions from most apps except whatsapp, Skype, Zoom, messages, etc. Have also denied permission of location, etc for all apps until I actually use them and need location access. Bluetooth, wifi, NFC, tap to wake, lift to wake etc are always off. I don\\'t need them and it\\'s disturbing to receive nonsense notifications. I am a hardcore PC gamer, and do not like to play games on the phone. I had always got mindblowing battery backups from my previous Samsung devices, and the Nord\\'s backup beat every one of them.8. That slider on the Nord is a magic wand. With my previous phones, I had to unlock, and then change profiles to ring, vibrate and silence. The Nord has a 3-point slider (yes, it is 3-point, and it took me a while to realise this as I thought it was 2-point at first). You can switch between ring, vibrate and silent just by the slider.9. There are options to set the display area to just below the front camera holes so they are not intrusive on the videos is awesome.10. There is also an option of \"greyscale\" that turns the display, and everything you see, to black and white, and this is system wide, and also turns the video playback to black and white, which I think is pretty awesome too.This part of the review is biased: My previous 3 phones have all been Samsung flagship devices, Note 4, A8, and then Note 8. They are absolutely brilliant devices, and I need to write a comparison for people who are thinking of switching.1. The camera on the Nord beats all of them is quality and real colour reproduction. The Nord\\'s front camera is better than all the Samsung device front cameras combined. Those were absolute garbage, a little better than VGA level cameras.2. Samung devices always have bad music quality, even with the dolby atmos turned on, and volume turned to max level. The Nord\\'s music quality is far far superior, even without touching the equalizer, and the volume halfway up.3. I never felt the need to use an S-Pen much on the Notes, and the thousands of software customisationsly  that Samsung offers. They are mostly a gimmick and you wouldn\\'t use them past the first 1-2 weeks of purchase. These features are not missed.4. Now, the Samsung flagship Super Amoled displays are better than Nord\\'s Amoled display. The whites on a Samsung are milky bright white, and the blacks are absolute deep blacks. This was system wide. The Nord\\'s blacks are greyish blacks, and the whites are greyish too. The reds on a super amoled is blood red, and the Nord\\'s reds are crimson yellow-ish. Similar with the blue colour. If you are coming from an LCD or OLED display you won\\'t notice any difference, but if you are coming from a Retine HD, or Super amoled 1080p/1444p 400 ppi plus display, you are going to notice it for a very long time.5. Samsung\\'s built-in theme store is very sorely missed. It was very exciting to change themes every 3-4 days, an have a complete system-wide new look. Oneplus\\'s software does not have themes. Third party launchers and theme apps, even paid ones will only let you customise the lock screen, home screen, and the menu icons. Everything else will still look the same. Also, the lock screen and home screen have nice contrast if you set an HD wallpaper. The rest of the system has a grey-ish black background if you set the \"dark\" theme, and greyish white with the default theme.6. I personally was a big fan of the old 3x4 keyboard layout that Samsung has built-in. I am now trying to get used to the qwerty srtyle keyboard. Third party keyboards are not as smooth as the default ones. Although Nord\\'s keyboard has a cool feature of setting custom background images on the keyboard.7. I do miss the 3.5mm jack. I could connect the desktop to usb tethering, or charging, and still listen to songs while I work. This is no more possible with the Nord. Some third party converters have a type c and 3.5mm jack split 2-in-1, but it can only be used to slow charge the device and listen to music at the same time, and not data transfer or usb tethering. This was important to me.Finally about my decision to buy the Nord: So obviously I wanted to upgrade to a Samsung flagship S-series or Note series device. But the choices were all above Rs.40k. That too after applying exchange value and discounts. The Lite series for the note and S series Samsung phones are all renamed lower-end phones and have horrible cameras, and other half-baked features. I also looked at LG\\'s G8X, and they were selling at largely different rates at different websites, and it was untrust-worthy. Moreover, all of the flagship phones are at 6.5 inch display sizes, or larger. I hate large displays that I couldn\\'t operate with one hand, and are not just practical for a primary device. I feel a  5.5 inch device is the perfect size. The Nord is bigger than that, but fit in one hand well. All the other features fit the bill perfectly. I was not ready to shell out Rs.40k and above for a phone I wouldn\\'t use to it\\'s 100% design and hardware capacity and intent, and I was getting the Nord at Rs.20k after exchange of my old phone.I am very happy with my purchase, and it was very much well worth it. I have played around with the phone, tweaked a lot features, and found the complete package far better than flagship devices from other brands. I bought another 2 Nords for family members, and they are happy with the devices too.\\n\\n',\n",

Not so good, not so bad.Pros:- Good design, feels premium even though the body is plastic- Good performance, no lag observed- Good call quality and music quality on headphones (compared to my oneplus 3)- Good signal reception and wifi speed.- Does not feel too heavy in hand and does not feel slippery with the case provided.- Smooth UICons: - Camera, this is is biggest negative of this mobile. I am not sure if it is the hardware or software, but it is bad. I feel my oneplus 3 produced better pictures with main camera. I do not see good colour reproduction, pictures appear little dull and low light picture is grainy. My family member's oneplus 6T is much better compred to nord's main camera. There is a huge huge difference in picture quality between 6T and this. I don't know what oneplus have done here. Selfie camera is also not good, oneplus 6T produces much better images. So if you are a photo freak, this is a big NO for you. Hope oneplus fixes it through software update. I am not much into photography with mobile, so I am fine here even though little disappointed.- Screen is not up to the mark. AMOLED with 90Hz disaply, really? Again I can compare it with oneplus 6T, and it looks better when playing games, videos or photos.- Battery drains faster without actually doing anythingOverall I do not feel this meets the standard set by oneplus, they have cut corners heavily, mainly camera and screen. This is just good enough as a daily driver, nothing great. I have gone for oneplus mainly for its support for good range of LTE frequency bands which can be used in countries like USA, compared to others in same price range. You will have better options for the price if your main concern is camera and you do not travel much to foreign countries.Update: After recent software update, camera is better and battery is not draining as before. Looks like it is improving. Giving 4 star.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  It's really a cool premium mobile with great camera quality, battery life and other such basic and additional features which makes the phone look alike a flagship. It's charging speed and connectivity options are a little bit faster than the last year's flagship from OnePlus, the OnePlus 7 pro. (I'm using both the phones and compared them practically)The major thing that made me to give 4.5 is the UI. It's similar to the Google UI which gives you a Moto experience. That's the only thing that I disliked. Other than that it's really a great mobile at a great price. I feel like Nord is little better than the 7pro (other than the UI) at half the price of 7pro.😉\\n\\n\",\n",

So choose carefully3) By chance if you buy, PLEASE DO NOT UPDATE the version, once you upgrade the version, you are dead on 4G, only Edge, that too God knows4) There is no Zero Star, hence had to settle for 1 Star. Worst OnePlus model.Please ignore the update given below:Aug 2020:Received the product today, my few cents:Pros:1) The processor is superfast and touch feel is really awesome.2) Back Camera is like any other 20k+ phone camera, good, but front camera quality is good during vide calls3) Build design is good and the new OS features are also good. Not gone thru all of them, the ones that are explored are good4) Battery - 100% Charged in the morning 10AM, after 8 hours at 6PM, 60% left which means it might come for 1+ day. Since the setup operations takes lots of juice, you can judge on your own.Cons:1) Fingerprint Setup is pathetic, the old fingerprint sensor is way better then this on screen one. You have to literally scroll your finger in all 8 dimensions for about 16 times before it completes the setup. Its lame in terms of technoligical advancement.2) Fingerprint recognization is okay.. not as good as the old sensors in 3T and other OnePlus models.\\n\\n',\n",

However WARP charge helps, only if u plug it to 30W charger.Screen though good lacks sunlight readability.Speakers get the job done.Camera is good.OS lacks many intelligent features that make life easy. No music, compass app.Calculator app is sluggish n lame.Uses googles dialer and calendar app, lame again. Oneplus Should have invested in proper apps with intuitive features. Its software which is more disappointing than the hardware.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  It’s not what every YouTuber is saying. It’s absolutely not like the magic Oneplus One was. The other two siblings of OnePlus Nord I have used as my secondary devices were Oneplus C and Oneplus 3T and both were amazing devices and are still with me. NORD is light weight good looking phone with ordinary AMOLED Screen and speaker.  I am not a gamer so it doesn’t matter how it performs there. No complaints from camera either but nothing great about it too. I also made a mistake of buying it in blue color. It’s so jarring that it started irritating me in a day. Another blunder- I started using blue sandstone case and I felt like throwing up. Now it’s in black color sandstone case and looks okay. So I suggest buy its black/grey color. There is no option of returning it unfortunately. And if you are coming from iPhone don’t even go close to it. You will hate it the way I do.\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n  The look and feel is very good.. the phone is very compact, handy and also felt light weight. I was previously using Asus 5Z and Vivo Z1x..First time user of Oxygen OS and I am loving it.. no unwanted ads and apps. Butter smooth performance. There are a few Facebook related apps which can be deleted by connecting the phone with laptop.. u can find this info in xda developers website.The 765G processor does a decent job.. I play games (PubG and COC) for about 3-4 hours a day.. and was spending more time on the camera for the past 3 days..Battery drains fast as I have nothing else to do other than fiddling with this phone all the time.. once the work life becomes normal the battery should be enough for 1 day.. as of now am charging for 2 times a day. Charging is fast with the 30W charger.I am a fan of black colour and first time I purchased a different colour the Blue Marble.. I was initially thought of canceling the order to swith the colour to Gray Onyx.. later thought I can try something new.. good that I did not cancel the order.. The Blue Marble is fantastic and gives a premium look..For those who expect a very fast shutter speed and image optimization dont go for Nord.. it normally takes about 2 seconds for the image to optimize and then display the actual image in portrait mode.. in nightscape mode it will take about 5 seconds.. I dont mind waiting for 2 or 5 seconds though.. There is a blink in slow-motion videos when you are in low light but I think it is the case with all the phones. The pictures are very nice.. I am sharing few pictures here.. The 2MP Macro lens could have been removed.. there is no use of it..As far as Gaming, I did not find any lag or heating issue.. if u r going to use the plain case that comes with the mobile, then u might feel a slight discomfort playing pubg.Display is very nice.. I did not have any Tint issue with my device or may be it was fixed with the recent update that was rolled out.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  GoodReviewing after one week usageIn hand feel is good. Back gorilla Glass protection feels good in hand.Mobile signal strength is good. Ear piece volume is  quite adequate, can be heard while you are outdoors on road and noise around.90Hz Refresh Rate is good.Oxygen OS is clean and bloatware freeCharges super fast. Takes me around 45 mins from 2% to 100%. I don't know if that's causing any long term harm to the battery.Opportunities of improvementBattery life is average. I get 4-5 hours of onscreen time with full charge. My usage is mostly whatsapp, email, couple of UPI payments in a day.  20-30 mins of youtube videos.Screen Brightness in outdoors - if you get a call when outdoors and it's sunny, you almost cannot see who called. You have to do some guess work and swipe down on screen to take callSpeaker quality is substandard - C'mon OnePlus, this is a Rs.28,000/- Phone. You definitely could have spent a little more on the speakers. It sounds horrendous.No headphone jackOnscreen finger print scanning is SLOW. Fails couple of times before you can actually get in.Camera - My daughter's  10k phone takes better pictures than this one.  I'm not a big fan of large megapixels etc. But you can see the photos taken on this phone are not great quality. Macro lens is useless. They have 4 cameras just for the sake of calling it quad camera phone setup. Again for the price range camera set up is substandard.5G - though it's not in India yet. Why does this phone cover only one 5G band?Performance - Snapdragon 765G  with 8 GB RAM sounds really good on papers. My 4 years old iPhone 7 Plus 3GB RAM performs much better even with a iOS 14 update.  I always feel, Apple should teach the rest of the tech world what optimization is.  Response from OnePlus support on battery life was not so great. They asked me to remove all apps and reinstall them. :)Overall it's a great feeling phone on paper. Would work fine for day to day use. But definitely not worth 28-30k.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Used it for 5 days by now and not happy with the purchase, not a value for money thing. I am a professional with average usage, no gaming, no video streaming, generalized basic apps, then too the phone drains battery and heating up every usage which is more than of 10 min. Even during audio con calls for 10 min or above it drain battery and heating up.The biggest drawback as I mentioned above but there few more here:1 - Not a great camera phone but I didn't required either, so decide as per your requirement.2 - Feel lagging in apps based on graphics usage.3 - No fast charger with box, but charger is ok.4 - Not an smooth performer and speed of operations keep vairing. Processor is of low capacity.Pros:1 - OnePlus branding.2 - Premium look and good aurgonomics.3 - Display is quite satisfying. But you could get a much better in same cost.4 - Finger print scanner is quick.5 - Sturdy and clean OxyOs.Verdict if you are not bothered about the brand name as I , than never buy this and you could get a far far better phone in brands like Redmi, Vivo or Realme... Go for those and don't feel compromised.\\n\\n\",\n",

The metallic finish and slim body makes it feel top of the world, for such a budget phone packed with multiple features that i shall be exploring on the go. The back cover is quite decent but okay but the most important fact is it has a waterproof protection over the charging point, which is the best part from a usability aspect. Above all the picture quality is very natural and most importantly just like iPhone without any additional filters that takes away the charm. Other than than that it is paacked with multiple camera features, that'll blow your mind.Most importantly the broad smile and happiness over my daughters face was priceless.

       " \"\\n\\n  Giving this review after 6 months of usage. Very bad front and back camera with very bad battery backup. Although it is fluidic fast but these cons make it an average phone. Had high expectations from one plus but they are a total let down. Battery backup doesn't last you even half a day. All day I am on battery saver mode still the battery ends by evening. 90hz refresh rate is just a gimmick nothing special about it. Camera pics are awful both front and back. A normal redmi phones click better pictures than this one. Avoid this phone.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  The moment you unbox this device you will feel this is a high tier device. one cannot easily find out that its made of plastic with gorilla glass 5 protection. The device is sleek and looks premium. i do like the slight gradient on its back. The camera bump is quite pronounced and definitely requires a casing which can prevent from smudges and other issues.it runs on android 10 out of the box  as expected for any modern android device currently available.the experience is smooth without any stuttering. 765G does performs well.coming to the displayDisplay is neutral and not overly saturated as compared to the OnePlus 6 that I have. But i must say the display is extremely well optimized for true to life colors. my OnePlus 6 kills the details when i run HDR videos which is not the case here. you will see the details and the texture well preserved in the nord as compared to op6. 90hz is becoming the new norm for  even in an entry level android and thats something which adds up to the smooth ui of the device.since i do have a k20 as well handy, the display of this device is no less vibrant and is vivid.another important criteria for me is camera. Its well balanced camera. the main camera borrows the same camera sensor i.e. the imx586 from OnePlus 8 which inturn has been used in the previous years OnePlus 7 series .  the colors are punchy, gets you through most situations without hassle. i do not use the macro sensor which is an utterly useless 2. megapixel camera. wide angle does its job well and thats an 8 MP. You do get depth sensor for portraits. Portraits are good if not the best . the night mode is improved as well compared to previous OnePlus. the selfies are a tad softer and i feel it can be little sharper. these companies force the skin smoothing on us. but some of us do not like this and would like to disable. Probably there could be an option which am yet to explore.  the wide angle in front camera is a nice addition for group selfies.coming to the audio is good. the loudspeaker sounds decent. its not a dual speaker on this front but a bottom firing single speaker which does it's job. the most painful part of today's devices which is almost like a plague is removal of the 3.5 mm jack. i dont know whats the real difficulty in adding a tiny little port. my OnePlus 6 has a 3.5 mm jack ans yet it maintains a slimmer profile than the nord.  its an annoying experience to carry around type c to 3.5mm adapters and not that u have too many good choices for a type c earphones. not all of like those bluetooth earphones which are quite a trend these daysso i do not have much to say about gaming.am not a gamer hence i cannot comment on this. but most likely the phone will be able to handle games like  pubg , asphalt 9 without hickups as seen on other tech reviews. moreover G model processors are wel optimized for games with higher clock speed set.thats pretty much that i use on a phone.i had options like Redmi K20 pro and also Realme X50 superzoom. K20 pro is definitely a device to consider if you are ok with an year old device. but u do get a flagship grade processor which is a powerful option as compared to 765G. but u lose out on 5G if u really care, for which we are not ready yet. u do get risinf camera which could be a concern in long run. but the non pro k20 with us is still doing fine. and few do not like the miui.but miui does have its own perks. I do like the option of lockscreen wallpapers which change frequently from the mi library and the content is rich.the k20 camera can be better optimized is what i feel.Realme x50 super zoom on other side is also a well packaged device however i wanted to go for a device with a Amoled since i do a lot of media consumption on my device where as the x50 had an LCD and one cannot get deep blacks and contrast on an LCD.most importantly i have been a longtime user of ghe oxygen OS. in simple words it's the no non sense UI and just as good as the Google's Vanilla Android UI. its blazing fast, updates get rolled out as soon as google releases.at last i had to chose a blend of everything for the money that i pay and nord was the device that fullfilled this. So in Nord you have 6Gb+128GB variant 25k which is coming in September, 8+128GB at 28k  and 12+256GB at 30k. at 2k increase i was getting a 4GB additional RAM and double the storage which made sense to choose this over other two variants.so who is this device for? i think its for some one who wants a flagship grade camera, a good punchy display for media consumption and social media,  but do not really wish to spend 40k plus but still get a flagship experience with few compromises in processor which is not a flagship but can still get you a snappy performance at a much lower price. you are also future proofed with this device ready for 5G.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  After months of deliberating over which phones to buy, I decided to, with the help of people, complete my purchase of the One Plus Nord. Got it on the 24th of March 2021 and Amazon delivered it speedily the next day morning. So 5/5 for the delivery. The packaging was good and secure. Again, kudos!  5/5 for the packaging.Truth be told, I was quite excited for the One Plus device. I knew it was not a flagship phone, but still, I wanted to go for something worthwhile. While 8 & 9 were beyond my budget, the one thing I had to settle for is the Nord. Only the 12GB + 256 GB version was available to me (all colours). I went for the Grey Onyx. Ash one looked subdued to me and Blue one looked quite bright. Even though it wasn't a flagship, it doesn't feel like I am using a midrange phone.I shifted to this device after four years of using Mi A1. While I loved the stock Android experience of Mi A1, I am more in love with the UI of Nord. Like all the reviews tell, Oxygen OS is one smooth UI, compared to the MIUI and other UIs. It updated to Android 11 almost immediately, even though Nord came with Android 10 out of the box. With two years of updates and three years of security updates promised, this looked and still looks a promising phone.It's been two days since I received the handset and I have been testing it throughout the day. The device comes with apps like Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, and Netflix pre-loaded. But it is okay.  These software are used day-to-day anyway. What's more important is the OS doesn't come with unnecessary bloatware.I got the 12GB Ram variant. So, let's say, speed is awesome. Obvious. Operating the phone is quite smooth. Also, has the 256 GB variant. So, lots of storage.I loved the display the most. Standing at 6.44 inches, the displays sports vivid colors. With a 90Hz AMOLED screen, it gives you a flagship like feel. One Plus has not made any compromises here. The haptics are awesome, scrolling is smooth, and it is such a joy to watch Netflix or play games on this phone. I would give the display a 5 on 5.Did I mention games? Yes, we can play games here, but make sure you get at least the 8 GB version. 12 GB is better. Two days, I have played Harry Potter Hogwarts: A Mystery, Township, Real Cricket 20, NFS No Limits, Asphalt 9. The first two do not require a lot of graphics capabilities, so it will work smoothly even in the 6GB variant. The other three require graphics and storage. So anything 8 GB+ is better. I played these games on the highest settings. I also had multiple apps running in the background. There were no lapses. The games did not hang or played slow. It was smooth. The 90Hz display made it look awesome as well. The Snapdragon 765G processor is really great to have while you play games. The device did not show any signs of heat until I consistently played it the whole afternoon, even then only so slightly. There's a gaming mode, which subdues notifications. There's also a Fnatic Mode, which is a pro gaming mode. I haven't tried that out yet, so I am a little confused about the feature so to speak. But once I do figure it out, I will let you know. For gameplay, I would rate this device 5/5.There's a dark mode in this device. There's also a reading mode, which has both mono and chromatic lens effects. If I had gotten some other midrange phone, I'd have purchased a Kindle. But, now, I don't feel the need. This phone has an excellent reading mode. It won't compare to the Kindle Paperwhite per se, but it does the trick. There's also a Zen mode for keeping away from distractions. There's also something called Work-Life Balance which doesn't let you allow notifications for a certain time period. Similar to Zen mode, but also different. I will let you know once I actually try them both out.Performance on this device is ultimate. The device is fast, but that might also be because of the 12 GB Ram I have. Scrolling through the app drawers is fast and smooth. I will rate this a 5/5.Phone display has Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. As far as I know, the phone has no IP rating, but I surmise it is safe from drops of water, sweat, rain, etc. Display comes with a pre-applied scratch guard, but it is prone to fingerprint smudges and dust.Fingerprint reader is pretty fast and accurate. There's face unlock as well, which is fast too.Coming to the battery life... the phone has a 4115 mah battery. With heavy usage, I got 10 hours of battery a day. But if you are not gaming the whole day, you might get up to a day's worth. At least 16 hours. There's a battery saver mode, which you can also schedule, that would save you more battery. But, yes, for this price, I was quite disappointed with the battery. It is not bad... pretty average I'd say. 3/5 would be my rating. I expected at least a 5000 mah on this one at this price.Regardless of the average battery life, the phone comes with a 30W warp charger, which charges the battery in about 50 mins to 1 hour, which is fast and awesome. This is a good trade-off, I think. You can charge the battery quickly.Coming to the camera, the phone a quad camera to the rear - a Sony IMX586. The main 48 MP camera is great but not as good as the flagship phones like One Plus 8 or even 7T Pro. But it is pretty great. It has OIS too, which is awesome. It captures colours very well. The second ultra-wide camera 8 MP does its job, but it is only decent at best. The other two cameras, 5 MP and 2 MP, are average. Actually, it would have better if they were not there. The macro is not as good as can be expected. The depth is not so good here. I would have liked a telephoto lens here, but at this price, I think the rear cameras are decent at best and the company did overhype it during launch. You're better off using the main camera for everything.To the front, One Plus Nord sports a dual camera. Primary is 32 MP and ultra-wide at 8 MP. The selfie cameras are better than the rear cameras. The primary one does the job well with the ultra-wide not far behind.As far as videos are concerned, the rear camera does 4k videos at 30 fps and 1080p videos at both 30/60 fps. The front cameras do both at 30/60 fps. The cameras do a great job at recording videos. However, they could have been better.For the camera quality, I would give it a 4/5. If you're into photography, you might want to consider a different phone. I mean, this does the job, but if you aren't a hobbyist, you might want to consider something else.I will update this review after a month and then three months to let you know more. :DBut I will definitely recommend this phone. It has the best spec sheet for a midranger. One Plus has made little to no compromise and the phone does make you feel premium.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is all what you expect from a 2020 smartphone! Everything seems really perfect!The cellphone feels more premium that what we actually pay for it!The user interface is really smart and snappy and it feels really nice while using the cellphone.This is my second oneplus device and I am really happy with it!The camera is really impressive...don't go with the negative YouTube reviews... It is really a flagship camera and you would love every single shot captured through it. The HDR is perfect and the edge detection is really impressive. And trust me the night mode is really ultra amazing!The only problem is that I just expected the battery to be bit more long lasting...it is not that bad but it's not that good either..but it gets charged quickly so it's not a big deal for me as well...but on a regular usage I think the battery performance is not that good and that's the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.I could really say that you can choose oneplus nord over oneplus 8 or 8 pro because there's not much of a difference in both of them. Personally I've compared oneplus 8 and 8 pro in real life with my nord and I still think nord is worth every penny and you could skip on 8 or 8 pro and go for the OnePlus Nord anytime!\\n\\n\",\n",

Getting location icon in status-bar even after location is turned off. It's a serious issue. every time I need to restart my phone to fix this issue.3. Phone gets heat if u use it while charging.4. After using the phone for few days (may be within 15 days) you will fell the lag in screen sensitivity (even if we run it in 90hz) 5. Call connectivity issue if u r using internet calling option. even though if your network is full and internet speed is in mbps your call quality will be worst.6. Battery discharges easily.7.

If not its left to you (if you think you got money from somewhere and somehow without any effort and if you feel 30k is just nothing)I'm feeling about myself that i would have use this money to buy some other phone might be samsung A71 or apple's iPhone SE 2020.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  This is my fourth one plus phone and I was always a strong fan of the brand till this buy. Still having a one plus 6 absolutely running fine with me. But this device Nord was a shocker.I have received a used/repacked item as in images from seller Darshita electronics.The cable looked really different and of local quality for a device worth 28 k.  Images of my 7t cable with Dash engraving and this local cable in images.There had been intermittent connectivity issues and network goes off completely at times with my Airtel connection.The adaptor connection with the 3.5 mm jack fails through the call but the same adaptor works fine with my 7T.The speaker volume varies in call and while listening.Awful camera - the Xiaomi phones under 10k gives you better images.The finger print reader works fine at times and creates all pain otherwise...My personal opinion on the usage of 3 days- absolute waste of money and a product to spoil the brand image. I lost my 28k😞😞\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  For fingerprint sensor it has a great job, and battery life could have been better (lets wait until the next update) but the major i got dissapointed is its front camera. Though it has sony 32MP camera it takes a picture like 8MP camera or 12MP camera i didnt like it that much, though i am not a camera user still for 32MP sony camera it could have done miraculous job i guess. And coming to back(rear) camera i felt its good but still for sony 48MP camera it can do much better job, I hope that in the future updates they may change all the camera performance(both rear and front). Lastly the smoothness, I loved it, the way they have made it is incredible and its very handy too, but one thing that is lagging is the price is too hectic for mid range but still I loved it. Except for cameras and battery life, you can buy it eye closed....\\n\\n',\n",

He's an enthusiast photographer, enjoys video and movies on youtube, a lot of multitasking and calls going through the day.The phone feels light in hand, not something bulky, though the structure is plastic but holding it in your hand or looking at it trust me you won't get the plastic feel. The fingerprint scanner is too quick and responsive.Charging was quite fast(26% to 100% in 45 minutes), the display is superb, clear and hell smooth (thanks to 90hz), speakers are loud too produces a crisp and soothing sound (please dont expect the performance of high-end speaker)The camera is good, captures a good amount of details in both 43MP and 12MP mode. The colours feel natural, autofocus was nice too as per the price tag but definitely not what they advertise it as one plus 8 camera. The camera needs more tweaks.

Hope you do understand the concern now and looking forward for your kind support towards the resolution as I understand that this product is a faulty piece which made my heart shattered and feel like lost the confidence in the brand.\\n\\n',\n",

The camera quality is good both front and back after the update!10. Battery life is good for non-gamers!11. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock works really well!!Con's:-1. Amazon's delivery got the phone delivered after 2 weeks!2. No headphone jack,but understandable given that tws is the future!!3. Tint issue though not a major problem but can be seen in dark conditions!The phone is good, but I would advise you to wait for Realme x7 pro and Poco's nord killer, compare them with Nord before you take your decision!!Have a good day!!!😄\\n\\n\",\n",

Screen resolution is also not upto the mark. Customer support is also very bad, the options which you get in budget Redmi phone is far better than this. I suggest not to buy this model.

       " \"\\n\\n  Let's start with the display of the phone one plus display is the better example in mid ranges phones range and camera is just as awesome as any other one plus phone and talk about gaming with the Nord was a good experience, though don’t mistake it for a gaming phone. Some 2D and lower-end 3D titles can easily hit the 90fps mark. You’d be happy playing 8 Ball Pool or Clash Royale on the Nord. However, heavier games such as Real Racing 3 and Fortnite do show some performance issues. Firstly, stutters are more frequent in high-action moments, such as gunfights in Fortnite. Secondly, frame rate drops occurred more often in games that rely on CPU-intensive features and if we talk about Battery of one plus so battery backup is never an issue with one plus because it comes with warp charger which takes your battery from 0 to 65 in just 30 minutes and lastly its price  I bought this awesome piece at 27999 from my icici amazon card by which I get 5% cashback...

If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU).

I am not satisfied with selfie cam in low light.The performance is average in heavy games but you won’t notice any problems in day to day tasks.The display is the best part about this phone the colours are punchy and gets plenty bright. The 90hz refresh rate with the180hz touch response is amazing and very smooth. The single speaker is loud but not as good as dual speakers. You will enjoy multimedia experience on this phone and the haptics are good too but feel a bit weak while typing. The battery is average too it lasted me a day with 7hrs of usage (without heavy games) but it gets covered up with the fast charging of 30 watts it only took 40 mins from 20% to 100.Overall I loved this phone but the selfie camera and macro camera needS improvements\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I've been using this phone for 2 weeks nowPros1. 90Hz Amoled Display  -- This is the cheapest device in market with an amoled 90hz screen.2. Oxygen OS3. Oneplus BrandCons1. Selfie Camera even with 0 beautification punches out extremely soft pictures. They are so bad, you can't even use them to post on social media. Taking group selfies with this phone is an embarrassment, as photos are so bad, that someone else would usually volunteer to take the picture.I also installed bunch of other camera apps to remedy this failure including google camera but camera's hardware is in itself pathetic.My Poco F1 took much better pictures.My friends (including me) expects better pictures from a Oneplus Brand but these images just completely ruins the brand.2. Oxygen OS takes 20+ GB of storage.I wanted to get the 64GB model but considering this and how in future updates, OS size will likely grow, I had to shell out more for the 128GB model.3. Bad Market PracticesWhile every other brand is giving off amazing discounts, Oneplus didn't. Not only they didn't, they disabled the HDFC 10% discount for the 64GB variant of this device.NORD likely has much  better profit margins than a lot of phones in the market. We all know, it's not a value but excluding your device variant from discounts is just bad.NORD lineup doesn't make sense at this price point. Oneplus should've been selling their last year flagships near this price but instead they chose to release a worse product with likely better profit margins.4. Misleading Ads, HypeGoing to Oneplus NORD website, you'll see claims like flagship camera etc. Opening up the box, you'll get a paper listing out what makes a smartphone great and how it is not always about specs. All that marketing and yet the phone is extremely average.ConclusionOneplus NORD is a fine phone. It would've made sense to launch this in Western markets instead of in India. We have much better options under 20k which makes this phone extremely over-priced.This is coming from a person who is not price sensitive, I was actually looking to buy Oneplus 8T (awful colors though)  or Samsung S20+ (Amazing Discounts, this season). But since I don't play games, I thought I was taking a wise decision going with a company which knows it's not always about the specs. Oh boy, I was so wrong.In the end, Nord is an overpriced, very average phone with a great display and a respected brand ( for now atleast )\\n\\n\",\n",

The main sensor is good. The 12MP wide angle is also good. OnePlus tweaks the software from time to time. If you really want to use Macro mode, just click using the main sensor and then crop in.

These games are not at all demanding and it still skips frames in those games, terrible optimization, I was not expecting great performance in demanding games but still it should be fine in less demanding games, which it is notEdit : just installed call of duty, surprisingly didnot experienced major framedrops. They were there, but I was looking for them, otherwise smooth experience, do not know why less demanding games like minecraft ans angry birds transformers have frame drop and this does not, I did not buy this phone for games at highest setting but for smooth frame rate, which it delivers in cod but in others, fails to do so\\n\\n\",\n",

Resolution is not Good... finger sensor is not good...One Plus should take back our Phones...as it have lots of manufacturing defects...So they give 3 updates in one month.Third Class Video Call...Network Problem...Don't waste your money in Nord.I request to One Plus please replace your manufacturing defect mobile.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I bought oneplus Nord last week which was delivered on 14th Aug 2020.  Phone worked well for 1 days and it stopped working on Saturday night.  I found phone is turning off and on within 30 secs on Sunday morning and if it turns on and stays for a min then there would be no network.  It would neither connect to home wifi nor mobile network.  It hangs and turn offs immediately.  I contacted Amazon for resolution and i was told to wait till Wednesday.  A technician will come on Wednesday to check whether phone is working is fine or not.  Nothing can be done before that and there is no option to send tech early.  I have no other phone till and there is no guarantee when would i get refund or replacement of this product.Very pathetic service and will not recommend to Anyone.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Lovely phone..people who are talking about bad camera quality.. must be shooting in auto mode.. the pro mode if handled properly works like a breeze n the picture quality is also fantastic. n one always insatl GCAM to improve camera performance. yes the macro cam is useless. n i think with few updates the auto mode will also work fine. the display is vibrant.. its smpoth with 90hrz refresh rate. the only thing that is bothering me is the in box back cover.. as i use gesture to navigate the phone the edge of the cover is too pronounced.. hence not been able to navigate smoothly. waiting for other cool back cover options to hit the market.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Oxygen OS is in Android mobile category plus phone specification and design are just like cherry on the cake. If you are switching to Nord from any MIUI OS device you would definitely going to have a roller coaster ride but still Oxygen Os need improvement as compare to MIUI in areas like gallary display,file manager options and some inbuilt apps are missing like QR Code scanner, no compass, IR blaster are missing, no memory card slot... Etc etc #Seh_Lenge... Still I will recommend you buy this as these cons are just 5% whereas 95% pros are waiting for you.... So definitly Go for this beast.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Overall I'm happy with the way this phone performs. Lets point its features out:- Great display fells extremely smooth thanks to its 90 hz refresh rate, colors are punchy on the phone and a bit on the contrasty.. side by default but you can change it to your liking anyway.- Performance is great 765G is more than enough for a lite user and by this I don't mean it won't perform if you want to play a few games on it. Works beautifully.- Now the only issue I came across while using this phone was its camera, even though it's being advertised for its bomb camera setup it's really not that special. The camera struggles quite a bit under low light or even a well lit indoor shot. This said I am pretty sure this will improve over time as this phone has the hardware to get those beautiful shots so its just a matter of time before OnePlus comes up with a few updates and fixes all these issue (well at least I hope they do!!!).So to summarize overall this phone is great and will satisfy your needs and expectations just dont think the same for its camera that's just poor :'|\\n\\n\",\n",

I was using one plus 7.. and now changed to nord.. camera quality is awesome, even in low light .. battery backup for a person like me who does most of his work over the phone is awesome.. i charge it once everyday.Smooth functioning and i love the new marble blue colour.

       " '\\n\\n  I have been using this phone since 1 week now. And below are my findings.Pros:1. Oxygen OS experience. Its fluid and smooth. I already got 2 updates in one week.2. Excellent display.2. Camera. OIS and nightscape mode is too good. The depth and macro camera is of no use.3. Main selfie camera is good.4. Body design is good. Phone feels premium and easy to hold.5. Fast charging. It charges the phone from 0 to 100 in around 50 mins.6. Gaming is smooth without any lag. I played pubg, 8 ball pool and bully-anniversary edition.Cons: I thing the battery life is average. Maybe the 90hz screen is draining it quickly. I am getting 1 day of backup with moderate usage.All in all, I think this is a good purchase. There maybe other brands that are offering better on paper specs in this price but remember the main usp of this device is the experience of using oxygen operating system.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Pros:1)  Oxygen OS, which runs as smooth as expected.2) AMOLED screen and 90 Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I am One Plus user since 2016, and Bought this Phone after a Lot of reviews and a months wait.No reviewer, absolutely no one pointed out the very fact that with great power comes great responsibility.If you ask me features.. i cant say they are any less than expected. I am not fond of photography, neither of heavy gaming. But I do require heavy multitasking, good network, seamless performance in day to day basis, good battery and clean OS. But this phone has all of them. More than what you will ask. It houses the same modem that OP8/OP8 pro has, same camera Hardware as OP8, Almost similar OS. Special mention for network and data speeds. It has LTE Advanced with several additional capacities and absolutely flawless network.Screen on Time (4-5 hrs) Consistent and Charging is flawless. Battery drain is more during Hotspot or Mobile data.Charger doesn\\'t heat the phone. but Processing doesBut only drawback is Snapdragon 765. It is by far highly weak for all of these.  It cant handle it for long and heats up too much. Even knowing this, the manufacturer has adopted different cooling systems like copper heat desiccator, on CPU, camera even at screen but of no help.I experienced heavy temperature up to  42-43 degrees on normal  usage and 45+ on 10 min video. Gaming also heats up equally. Even OP  customer care agrees 45 degrees damages CPU..Story of return... Something you should be aware ofI dint order return till 7th day. in all these 7 days I contacted Amazon CC and Oneplus CC. Followed their suggestions,  Wiping out Cache, Testing in Safe Mode, Factory Reset, etc. Followed min 20-max 80 % theory of battery chargingOn 7th day when I ordered return, I understood few conditions of 7 days return warranty. It saysItem received is physically damaged; (you should report in first 48 hrs)Item received has missing parts or accessories;Item received is different from their description on the product detail page on Amazon.in; orItem received is defective/does not work properly.Now its the last case for mine, but its highly subjective. Who will determine thisAmazon has a technician who will visit and inspect.Who are they, they are third party engaged by Amazon.the First visit fellow, from (TROUBLE SHOOTING).This fellow calls me at 11th hour (half hour before service needs to be completed as per schedule).He says he will come in few minutes and ask me some details.after few hours, i find My service is completed.What is the report?  my phone is working fine and no issues,That should make it non eligible for return.That is where Amazon comes to rescue. They listened to my issue and Arranged another senior technician.Also share that the only technicians report is not everything. By the time I already have temperature screen shots. I shared these with the second technician and he agrees to \"Item received is defective/does not work properly.\".Thankfully my phone  return in picked up and money credited back. Thanks to amazon.and I ordered my other phone (off course not NORD) from amazon (!).So these are few words of caution.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  From opening up the box to setting it up and using it, OnePlus Nord provided a delightful experience, be it in terms of the fluidity or performance. As expected from OnePlus, it was a breeze to update the OS, apps and the UX was top notch. Warp charge 30T worked as advertised, topping up the phone pretty quickly. The camera performance was decent although OnePlus should have skipped on the gimmic of numbers and gone with just two good ones at the back. In my limited testing for two days, battery life was above average, netting me 7 hours of screen on time with location and auto brightness on, using only social networking apps and light games. This is bound to get better as the phone learns your usage habits and accomodates accordingly. The most unfortunate part was quality control for the display, a pink tint that covered about 25% of the right side of Nord's display under 50% brightness. It was terrible and noticable even inside a well lit room, provided the screen was under 50% brightness. This forced me to return this otherwise lovely phone as it was a deal-breaker. I'd still like to place orders in future to try my luck in what seems like a display lottery as the phone experience is rather well balanced. It's a recommended purchase provided you get one with a good display, otherwise return it.\\n\\n\",\n",

Overall a pretty sweet phone with good built quality (It does not matter much that the frame is plastic afterall you are going to protect it with a case at the end of the day).Only thing that is lacking is the camera (a little bit) but that can be improved with updates.Otherwise I am satisfied with my purchase and it is a phone which is overall a very good device with good haptic feedback , topnotch indisplay fingerprint sensor etc. Talking about the tint issue , this can be solved with software update and hope that OnePlus would look into this issue and resolve it as soon as possible with a software update.\\n\\n',\n",

Micro camera is just to add numbers. Night mode is also not so great. It has Google dialpad.

The nord completely meets my expectation.Battery could have been a lil bit better but also don't forget that the device runs in a 90hz refreshing rate which can be reduced to 60hz as well for longer lasting of the battery and the warp charger is great too, charges from 0-100 in around 70mins, which is quite good i suppose.People saying it's a over-hyped phone, it ain't, other brands are jealous of oneplus the way they are capturing the market!Go for it without a second thought, you won't regret.\\n\\n\",\n",

Even though my phone has 12gigs, it cannot keep more than 5 apps running in background and no app running in background after 15-20min, so just forget about heavy games which is not expected from OnePlus and that too from a 12gigs variant. I know keeping apps running in RAM could  drain the battery but let the users decide it :)Another thing is camera. Seriously macro lense sucks and is waste of space, waste of money, waste of time. Camera app needs a software update. Output images are not as great and consistent as from OnePlus 8 even though OnePlus's is claiming same module. Well mentioned issues can get solved in future updates. Display is awesome, but even my handset has that greenish shade issues when seeing  at screen in very dark room which isn't a big deal. If you're switching from a 800 series chip then you'll definitely see the performance difference but 90Hz covers it smartly.

       " '\\n\\n  Unlike what OnePlus had profoundly mentioned in their Amazon portfolio, the camera is ANYTHING BUT FLAGSHIP! 2MP macro is a \"2020 Joke of the Year\". Primary cam takes sharp photos under broad daylight but lacks depth. Under low light conditions, it just gives up. About selfie cam, don\\'t even get me started. Overall, all SIX cameras suck.Processor is fast, but there are faster ones in the market within the bugdet. So, gamers.... DON\\'T invest here.Battery lasts a day on medium usage. If you are a heavy user, DON\\'T buy this phone. 90Hz refresh rate drains battery even faster. Wanderlusters, please keep the charger and an ELECTRIC SOCKET handy. Recharging is quick. Very quick.Fingerprint reader is fast, if not superfast like those physical ones. So unless you are stupid, refrain from comparison.Oxygen OS in one word: AWESOME. This was one of the major reasons why I purchased this phone. Bloatware free UI is something I had craved for. I hated those unsolicited ads on Xiaomis and Oppos and Honors et. al. Also, a near-flagship from Samsung or Apple was out of question as I like my kidneys more.Long-story-short: Touch, look and feel is premium. Great UI.

       " \"\\n\\n  Display quality is not as good, coming from the oneplus5, the amoled of Oneplus5 is far better. Color is not same and saturation is also not good. I think it's really cheap display.I didn't notice any green tint issue.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Overall phone is good. Camera quality is good. Built is also good.Lot of Bluetooth issues. Bluetooth connection is unstable and noisy. So cannot use Bluetooth headphone. This phone does not have audio jack either so no way we can use headphone.This BT issue is persisting even after multiple OS updates pushed by OnePlus.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Got this about 1.5 years back to replace a One Plus 5Pros:- Decent screen - Comes with 120Hz refresh rate. A feature my iPhone XR lacks. Colors and resolution are also good.- Speedy - it is still super fast to use 18 months later.- Fast charging - love the fast charging capability + bundled charger- Build quality - fair. Doesn’t feel cheap.- 5G - It came with a tech that still isn’t available to use but brownie points for future proofing.- Fingerprint reader - quick and works without issueCons:- Cameras - they are simply sub par. Not much to be said here. If you need good cameras please look elsewhere. Be it front or rear camera, either are not comparable to flagship phones 3-4 years old.- Battery life - could be better.- Auto brightness - hate the auto brightness settings on this. Simply doesn’t work well. Not sure if it’s a cheap brightness sensor or software.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Dislikes : I dint like the seller experience while placing the order. I placed the order on 25th Aug and item was supposed to get delivered on 30th Aug however the seller dint dispatch the order till Friday and then the delivery date got changed to 2nd Sep. Seller was unresponsive and dint respond to the email. Very bad service . Though i received the product on 2nd but i never expected this kind of overall service by Amazon.Likes: Phone is simply awesome. This is my second buy from One Plus (first one was one plus 3t). In simple words i really loved the phone.  The grey one looks really nice. Though the back panel is plastic made but they have made it look very nice. Good one.Well one thing which i dont like about the new one plus models is the wire jack . We need to use a connector . Rest all good. I guess the One Plus Lite model will have that wire jack feature.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Positive:1. Good display and touch (Pink tint issue is there but it will not hamper your experience)2. Decent sound on both speaker and earphones3. Main camera (48MP) is good4. Brilliant RAM management, No lag observed in normal usage5. Satisfactory battery life and fast charging works perfectly6. No heating issue observed during normal usage and fast charging7. Finger print and face unlock works perfectly8. Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is good enough and the call quality is also pretty much standard9. Blue colour is really good and weight distribution is great. In hand feeling is good.10. The clean and add free UI of the oxigen OS will make it way different from other android phone of this budget11. Back cover is really good. No complain on the pre-applied screen guard12. Haptic feedback motor is just OkayNegative:1. Below standard camera performance at low-light, selfie camera is not that sharp or good. Slow image processing noticed. Software optimization required. OnePlus could provide a telephoto lense instead of giving those bad depth and macro lenses2. 90hz display is not as smooth as I expected. Software optimization is required3. Auto brightness could have been work more smoothly, Jarking noticed when the brightness is getting increase or decrease. Again the software optimization required.4. 3.5 mm jack is not there. At least the type C converter must be included in the box5. Sometime noticed the screen gets tapped when the fingers are extremely close to the screen.Verdict:1. Good for a reliable daily driver but probably the gaming experience will not be immersive2. 5G has no use. The device could be configured with SD 730G chipset since the performance is pretty much similar to the 730G based devices. Price could be reduced atleast upto 5K by Using the 730G processor3. Balanced device. This device has no extraordinary feature and has nothing extemely bad4. 12GB variant is the best value for money option5. Over hyped and little over priced. Only go for it if you like OnePlus and it's clean UI\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Phone is good looking and handy, feels like a premium phone, Camera is awesome and must buy phone under 30,000/-. More fully it doesn't feel more weight and feels really weightless one and warp charge also does its job quickly and when my phone is at 80%, while you charge it shows 8 to 9 minutes to get fully charged. Phone doesn't get heat while charging....including charge holder.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Bought a phone.All over performance is good but unsatisfied with battery,As i am charging my phone twice a day.And when i am trying to replace the phone technical team of Amazon just test my battery online by blancco app.and said its not as per our term's and conditions as your battert is working good.But i am using phone since 4 days and daily charging my phone twice a day.And i have not a single game in my phone.Unsatisfied with battery performance and policy of Amazon.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  NO TINT ISSUEI TURNED ONT HE PHONE THEY GAVE ME AN UPDATE...SO typically your phone brightness level0 - 100 levelthey palyed it smart .. they removed 0--50 levelsSo technically when u slide to the left end on the brightness tab to reduce ur brightness thinking it would go to 0.. well it\\'s actually 50th level portraying as 0 .. My First costly Smart phone.Well.. For average person I mostly invest under 15k for a smart phone.. Now I\\'m in work from home and I need a phone which has a fast performance to toggle between apps for my communication / multitasking without any lagging or unwanted adds... And ya bla bla people who worship camera as if they are Ravi varmans cousin\\'s...  Guys this phone is literally a mustang coated in Ferrari dust...*Hard build even though claims to be plastic body* A devil Performance which u can expect from no  Android phone.* Yes fast charging helps us stay alive.*It has a open \"allow access\" system which I like so that I can monitor which app is using my phone tools..* When smart phone concept came to the marked I started with Samsung Galaxy pop moved to Moto G then redmi 4 ... Now it\\'s NORD...I bought it @ 25k by exchanging my redmi 4.. a decent buy for me.Rating:Back camera:5/5Front camera:4/5 because pics look slightly animatedPerformance: 5/5Battery:4/5 you can expext 6-7hrs max.. but fast charging helps u in 30-45mins charge sets full battery..Design: 5/5Durability : No IP certification so try to avoid water drops and dust touching the device.People buying this in Chennai .. remember only one service center available... Tnagar..I recommend you to use the back case given buy them ..it\\'s durabale.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Nord shows 4 camera lens and two of those bottom are fake.. top lens might be for face detection.Only one lens actually is used as capturing photo.Very disappointed even Amazon is playing along in this scam. Now that is the reason recent nord is launched with only two camera lens. Had seen a video in YouTube in which a guy remove the nord lens and shows the bottom two lens are fake. OnePlus finally achieved in fraud activities. I paid 30 k for this fake camera phone. One plus brand is now a fake brand on goin latest design also will get more fake options and conduct more fraud.I will not ever recommend OnePlus to any.If this is not posted here I shall post on my social platform. With video.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  It's best product...OnePlus is a brand and...Nord is a new direction...camera quality is better but not as good as 8...and battery life is quite good and it's charges 40 min 0 to 100....it gaves the best performance....and here is 90hrtz refresh rate then it's best but...if u used 60htz refresh rate phone then u will see definitely the difference... Face unlock is so fast but fingerprint scanner is not so good...and AMOLED display is the best... U must need to but this product....and now new direction comes in my life I m happy to get it..😋😋\\n\\n\"]"

       "' display has green tint issue display looks like a very cheap quality phone want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone prosmooth os no lags at allamoled screen is good quality screenprivacy no useless apps like those found in chinese phonesall other pros we would expect for these specs no deviationsconnot a metal framecpu is slower compared to current flagships this is expecetd note i am releived the display is fine at low brightness i read some users sharing the green tint issue i did not face that yet will update reviews in case of any issues i used several phone except like this type of phone but this phone is very silky smoothy hz refresh rate speed is very good or smooth like an iphone the keypad touch was also very smooth audio is mono speaker only but it is also good audiable something missing in the speaker the camera is fair i think next update this camera quality also increase this phone very very user friendly wrap charging is minute time take to charge completed that was very excited the i appreciated oneplus company because of less price for nord don t go on brand name and look very bad camera i have vivo z pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and vivo is only for k one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust this is really a overpriced and my first and last oneplus product it s very poor phone company lair battery charger min but it s not true star for the display green and purple tint clearly visible in daylight without even going into dark room and reducing brightness even the black bar is clearly visible in dark theme my iphone and oneplus have a better panel than this and stars to amazon and the seller darshita electronics for the delay in order preordered on th and received on th whereas people who ordered on prime day sale got the phone quicker will never pre order again and definitely not from amazon oneplus nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment pros device is pretty impressive and looks premium screen looks great camera works descently but after some struggle warp charge gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking screen brightnesscons even when snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range it s the one with same performance as snapdragon wrapped up with new ai engine it still struggles to maintain smooth experience screen refresh rate of hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate mono speakerit s not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass ufs the storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you ve used ufs all over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it i have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool if you re the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours i would recommend you to reconsider this once again this thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance oneplus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great oneplus nord does not make upto it s marketing hype there are several potholes in this smooth experience and i expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment it s just a midranger phone in the end for the best you can have i would suggest that you should see pro from oneplushope this helps thanks i was skeptical about changing from one plus t to nord as still have more processing power than and g won t be available in india for next years nord has gorilla glass whereas op t had gorilla glass but in the end i am happy i switched phone seems snappier better display and new design camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation i don t do gaming so series was not necessary for me nord seemed like perfect substitute since i am on oneplus since oneplus days where is call recording option being oneplus user from start expected lot from this mobile nord in hand doesn t give that premium experience that u get from rest oneplus mobiles build is very cheap this mobile is like oppo vivo should hav gone for oneplus extremely dissatisfied i was opted for exchange with my redmi note pro to purchase oneplus nord gb modal i am impressed with oxygenos bloatware free and camera especially main camera video and slow motion videos are superb pro s oxygenos gives very good user experience than other android mobiles hz fluid amoled display camera s image processing is very good in this mobile while using back main camera nightscape slow motion video and front camera stable video recording with optical and electronic image stabilization supports g network i am not sure when it is going to be launched in india may be in snapdragon g g chipset supports g network with midrange performance excellent for daily usage cons camera s for depth and macro photos especially mp macro lens giving poor quality output not suggestable for users who prefer heavy gaming like pubgi don t find more cons as of nowcolor tint issue not found in my mobile while screen light dims less than if your priority is not gaming this could be considerable option phone phone is fantastic everything as expected but the box was open no seal on box though items are fine inside but might be duplicate as well this is not a good exp for a prebooked phone box waste of money not at all satisfied poor camera quality poor product quality better to buy redmi mobile i don t like this phonecompany says no replacement or no cancellationthis is cheating hey guys i won t go in specs details as you are not reading this to read the specs i got it on nd august and after more than hours of use i can say my decision and wait was all worth it phone is great one plus is indeed flagship killer its manufared by oppo india and i have serious piece of advice for people who are considering buyingoppo reno dont waste your money there instead get nord i have seen for years how oppo charges atleast k premium for devices that have even year old processors you can get sd instead of sd and even nord s top varient costs k less than reno shit and those considering realme x pro zoom there s nothing special about it except for the fact that you wanna buy go with sd only you can seriously consider buying nord coz apart for sd nord is better in every department and you don t realise any difference whether its day today tasks or heavy gaming first of all i wanna thank amazon delivery service to deliver the product on right time as i want to gift it to my sister oneplus is a no match in this range you should go for this without any doubt except poor camera quality eveything is superb snapdragon g is fast and hz display is superb i am not getting screen tilting problem in low light as some users reported one more low point is that it does not feel premium as its side is made of plastic go for it without any second thought i will edit my review after some days of use in love with the camera quality and the color of the phone works smoothly impressed also online sale is on th and i got it today on nd swift delivery not value for money you are spending k for one plus phone but they not providing same to u for same feature you will get in k phone only plus point is in one plus is this is g ready and gb storage phone i have shared some pictures of oneplus and same i have click from k phone real me pro and i feel real realme bttr phone compair to oneplus very bad experience don t buy this product the mobile display lighting very dull compare with redmi mobile s and mobile over heating and camera quality very worst don t buy this product if you want this mobile please reach out nearby oneplus showroom and use this mobile and if you satisfied then you buy this product i m very unsatisfied this product had lots of expectations on this device but it destroyed in an hour camera is literally bad i mean really really bad still i had considered this because of oxygen os display tent issue if you turn down the brightness below fast charging doesn t at all support see the picture of my phone takes more than hour approximately to get full charge speaker sound is not good i would say okay extremely disappointed had to return this expected a lot now struggling to justify myself obliviously pre ordered and got it on th aug keeping all the hypes aside its a decent phone with all the latest features and an average performance in most of the areas camera doesn t sound to be bad as like most of us heard on the initial reviews its in fact truly awesome but few distortions in low light and indoor clicks also no tint issue so far for me which has been widely reported we will definitely going to miss the ear phone jack and memory card slot in this new oneplus nord obviously its a genuine g phone though india yet to upgraded to that level as per me below are key challenges which i am experiencing currently with this nord average touch response though it offers amoled screen and hz refresh rate problems in reflecting actual network signal strength nord is not a good option for gamer s battery performance is absolutely average but w warp charge power adapter is a blessinghope oneplus will soon come up with some software upgrades and reduce the impact due to the above challenges for their users if you are not looking for a high performing flagship mobile nord could be a king and satisfies you in all the aspects still its a mid rage king camera selfi camera is great back camera is medium quality not great like pro i tried gcam in this mobile image quality increases performance blazing fast like sd there is no difference noted in using daily usage you only notice difference in heavy gaming and heavy tasks from g and processors speaker its is loud enough and does its job for its price for of phone dont expect like flagship speakers if u put volume below volume of speaker is low and increase the volume above then speaker volume increases suddenly at volume sound comes with some noise battery i got sot of hrs with hz battery losts easily for one day when using camera battery drain faster display great display like t blacks are deep no tint issues in display colours are accurate viewing angles are great all google apps in dark mode are in grey colour this is not a tint issue so dont decide tint issue with google apps use dark wallpaper and then decide ur tint issueverdict if you are a heavy gamer only with ultra high gaming settings is not suitable but suites for lite gamers and camera centric user this mobile is not for u apart from camera and speaker it is great phone mainly value for money it was a big jump for me from budget phone to one plus nord i was skeptical before buying such high price phone and that too without any discount i bought during amzon pre order period as it has to be gifted to my wife inr but after i open the pack i felt relived build quality is superb and feels solid photo quality is plus plus i took some photos in dark and they were crisp and clear colours of photos looks natural and attractive i never looked so handsome before i need more time to explore all pro features overall all are plus plus as of now my wife loved the phone and thats the biggest plus i always want a oneplus mobile now i have one it s a good mobile first things first i m very impressed by the amazon delivery services coming to nord it got all the hype easily recommendable if you use it as a regular phone for social media and business purpose it is not so great for gamers so think before you buy it and compare all the other options too last things last overall performance is very fast and enjoying the oxygen os this is my first and last phone from oneplus worst phone i ever had in my life even after lots of users request bluetooth issue is not solved as no mm jack and bluetooth headphone keeps disconnecting now i have put this phone on speaker while video conferencing you cant even exchange this phone anywhere literally nowhere try it before you buy and no one would by this as second hand phone worst service ever after days of purchase i got software problem in my phone phone stuck in oneplus logo i clem for warranty but service center told me rs bill for software issue without my permission he heated my mobile and asking for payment for mobile now phone in my showcase i purchased phone in rs now what should i do an absolute wastage of money the product worked fine for initial days later faced issues like battery draining mobile heating mobile lagging when i tried to replace it the return window was closed i tried to contact the seller emails and the seller has not bothered to reply to a single email so i visited the oneplus store where i was told that certain rd party apps cause bugs and lead to battery drainage or lagging issues and i should wait for further updates from the applications so that the oneplus software can then be compatible speaking about the camera front camera is terrible it resembles front camera of smartphones like oppo vivo sharpness is too high for the camera utter waste overall i would suggest don t fall or get fooled for the oneplus flagship because launching something for k only because you gained a lot of popularity is pathetic there are many other good smartphones in the similar range that are performing pretty well than the nord phone oneplus nord has been a total disappointment and a poor purchase leading to wastage of money after moth i am writing this review i never wrote this type of negative reviews please do not believe all youtubers reviews sorry to say this points i only faced or others also faced these type problems i don t know one day suddenly all data erresed and got updated so carefull i am very disappointed for this because i am not gamer only official and daily use for me no tint issue display is good in our family bought mobile we did not face any problem apart from this mobile they ony created big hipe and over advertisement there are many mobiles with good proccecer and software for this price range i hope oneplus will solve this software issue otherwise they will loose people faith call quality signal strength no issues after sudden reset now i am facing battery drainag and mobile heat issues before my mobile was very cool and no battery drainag issues now i am facing this new problem if solve software issue that s great i sent mail also i will update my reievw but friends think think twice before buying because we are spending hard earned money it s should not go waste thank you it s delivered today rd august branding level improved some sticker in box mobile is lite weight color is extremely premium screen quality same as t let s wait for detail feedback hope it will good a lot of people have given their expert opinions here so i m just gonna address a few things display yes there is a tint issue but i feel oxygen os ac da has solved it to an extent my recommended setting isdisplay calibration advanced display p and tone it down to cold camera i seriously don t know why people are soooo critical about the cameras i know it s not that great but it s not that bad either people are paying half the price of one plus flagships and expect the same quality though both and nord have the same primary camera lol of course they are gonna bring improvements but it s not going to exceed some people s expectations battery life it s not that great it s mainly due to that hz refresh rate p s not attaching any photos there are enough of them here pre ordered and waited like anything arrived on time everything is fantastic in nord except display color leak or i don t know what to call it i shared images and videos go through it why why why faulty products just received oneplus nord grey gb variant and trust me guys it is just amazing worth every rupees display tint issue in my modelamazon refused to replace my phone a bad phone asked to return refused to return no such phone is mentioned feeling bad one of the worst front cameras in recent days apart from that it s a deal at this price it doesn t seem like that camera is stolen from oneplus worst experience with camera this phone is about nothing but only the hype they have created in the market it s better to ban these chinese phones i m not even satisfied with the display it doesn t look like a amoled i heard a lot about oneplus so i ve tried it for the first time but totally different from what i ve heard waste of money in this segment k we r getting a lot better phones think twice before you buy this phone so i suppose i m the first one to receive this beast from amazon arrived damn early then expected talking about phone display hz fluid amoled display is amazing just can t resist to use for a longer time processor since there was lot of hype for this new sd g which supports g i ll put it this way that it supports intensive gaming as well played pubg and there is no lag at all and opens game in a flash there is gaming mode for gamers handles everything very smoothly camera haven t tested a lot yet though main camera is good same as op but other camera are not that great as one might think they work good though and at this price you can t argue for more it has wide angle and that is good as well nightmode haven t used till now will post that as well once i ll test that battery till now it s awesome mah battery is sufficient for a day s work if we include gaming you might want to charge twice a day but again that s ok so bang on charging t wrap charging it quite fast ui who wants anything else if you get oxygen os best in class and superior factor to consider op phones it classy no bs at all authentic op design design and build nice build fits perfectly in hand gorilla glass in front and back just plastic in side and that s not an issue in anyway overall it s a powerful package from op i would say worth the hype go for any color you like i preferred grey onyx box included oneplus nord rcc card high quality transparent case case is literally very good i just want one more case in case i need in future p yrs of confirmed os upadte and moreover there was already an ota update when you switch on the device for camera and other bug fixes amazing work by op just awaiting for pre order gift vouchers now okay so firstly horrible delivery by amazon india i placed the order on th july it got shipped on th august and was delivered by th this review will be completely unbiased and will come from an user who used vivo v pro beforehand like all of you i also believed that nord did not live up to the hype by seeing it get criticised by reviewers but trust me this midranger gives you the same premium feeling as you would expect in a flagship device not joking it s beautiful obviously if you come from a device like oneplus it s a downgrade no doubt i wanted to buy the t for it s features and processor but i bought the nord why k cheaper than t better selfie camera composition same bloatware free oxygenos hz fluid amoled display trust me guys it s buttery smooth i found it brighter than my vivo and way smoother due to the hz panel you will get addicted to the display sd g day to day tasks like swiping moving through apps is as fluid as found on higher premium oneplus devices i compared the swiping speeds with t pro it could catch up with the t pro i m not a heavy gamer i usually keep my gaming sessions short like for mins at a stretch and i m done i noticed zero frame drops playing cod it ran very smooth no lags build quality i don t know why so much people are making a fuss over the plastic frame i used an unibody cheap plastic built v pro and coming from that the nord felt very premium in my hands it is really compact inhand feel is awesome you can feel it s a premium device when you hold it stop believing crap like the phone feels less premium due to it s plastic frame we wouldn t even know it was plastic unless it was clarified by oneplus user interface coming from a trash funtouchos the oxygenos is heavenly it runs apps very smoothly and really fast no complaints i don t know how many people would want to know but the ultrawide angle selfie cam is pretty useful it helps super linear bottom firing mono speaker the speaker has way more better clarity and loudness than my v pro yes it s definitely not loud as the t t pro but it s loud enough would not complain here s what i do miss tho i really miss the headphone jack i don t have money to buy tws rn so i do dearly miss the headphone jack i expected ufs storage but is okay you wouldn t notice if you aren t that nitpicky the camera quality i would say for an all arounder star device like the nord it s okayish it gives you really good day light pictures with decent details it won t disappoint you in any aspect if daylight pictures are concerned the pictures look natural not artificially boosted and punched like vivo phones the ultra wide sensor gives you really good colors and you won t really find any difference until you zoom into that picture for details i could get very good if not the best portrait shots and the macro camera well it s useless don t use it overall i know oneplus will definitely improve the camera on this through regular software updates unpopular opinion even if a premium phone with better cameras and a flagship processor comes out in the market i would prefer oxygenos rather than choosing any of the realme miuis etc phone received today bought it for my mother she seems to like it a lot software experience as expected is very smooth no lags faced would have loved a headphone jack instead of some of the camera only the primary rear camera is good accessories are all good tried out the cameras with gcam mod and the results are comparable to a pixel phone well oneplus gave decent primary front and rear camera hardware but software is bad the battery life is good hrs of video and browsing and loss of battery so expect it to last all day for sure worst phone the media could not be loaded worst just got the mobile st impression minimal design no useless app got the os update but the camera not statisfied currently i m using poco f even though the nord has quad rear cam with latest sensor but the images are too grainy my poco f produces much more better image this is within hours review after having the product i ll update further after using it sometimes perfect mobile everyonein this mobile very good pics very clear very light weight smoothy touch sound very good in mobile gb ram and gb what a speed i love this mobile very muchin this budget great mobile nord seriessuperb performance i had ordered a oneplus nord from amazon on th of august it was delivered on th of august after using it for a week the display was distorted i took it to the service center and i was told that this is a manufacturing defect and will be replaced in days i submitted my device to the service center on th of august meanwhile when i tried to track the replacement i tried to reach out to oneplus customer support via email chat service and call i was unable to get any response regarding replacement after emails calls and interactions with the chat service to escalate the issue to a higher authority in the company on september rd after days i received replacement but i was not given any acknowledgment for the replacement it turned out that the replacement was also defective with display issues now they are not even responding to me regarding replacement of nd defect device one of the worst customer support services on this planet earth buyers beware and proceed with caution i will never buy a oneplus device ever again till i exist pre booked on july and got delivered in aug after a day use felt that hz is added factor those who are watching p movie and high end gaming first time charging took lot of time and second time mins charged from primary reason for purchasing nord is for camera spec and advertised as copied from onplus but failed to impress i think camera is borrowed from budget phone definitely not from oneplus quality is same as expected sharpness in image image is blurred while zooming image quality is at par with redmi note sound quality is borrowed from cheap china mobile not expected from oneplus felt battery getting drained too fast for normal usage hope oneplus is listening all nord users concern and it will be addressed in oxygen os i really loved everything its ui features battery life is really good charging speed is also well other all aspects are pretty good speakers are not that bad enough for a phone but still it lacks camera is good but expections were much high accessories costs very much overall good one but now comes to its issues that display tint issue connectivity problems sometimes then idk why but charging is not that fast then game like ff isn t working properly idk still why camera optimization is poor please those who all have these green tint issue in your phones better to get a replacement or return because it s a hardware fault i ve gone for a replacement n as stocks aren t there so i got the refund better do it unless you want a defect product display itself not working did not expect this from oneplus how did it pass qa and delivered to customer if the display itself not turning on i got my mobile through pre booking and returned it when i asked about replacement they said there is no replacement stock eventhough regular stocks are on sale worst mobile buying experience ever pros software experience is awesome cons poor camere performance battery drains quickly lagging found while using some apps swipe i bought gb ram variant let s talk about pros ans cons battery life battery drains too fast however it has fast charging as well but you need to charge your phone very often for battery it last up to hours on screen that s pretty low when you are into phone all time front camera picture quality is average not that great biggest drawback is after clicking selfie you need to be still for atleast seconds there s a lag between when you click pic and when it captures your image and that s really annoying another major drawback poor quality in low light back rear camera picture quality is good also in dim light gaming pubg it runs smooth with graphics fingerprint i am first time using on screen finger print and i am not liking it at all again it takes seconds to response arrgghh annoying when you are in hurry all over better go for flagship phone it is not worth spending money i feel like i can get same features or better features in some other brand in lesser price i ve been following this phone to buy ever since they started the project hoping it would be good what you should not expect a flagship level gaming performance a flagship quality camera that it will be super easy living without mm because i still find it a bit difficult to get used to but it s a worthy trade off what you can expect a flagship quality performance in terms of day to day usage because the bloatfree oxygenos makes sure you do a beautiful display with a must have refresh rate all day battery with proper fast charge a lot of people might be expecting a better battery life but if you are using hz it will be like this no matter which company you use i meant proper because most of the phones get hot while fast charging but this didn toverall it is a phone which is a perfect daily driver with a good gaming performance and if you believe a phone is more than what the spec sheet says then this is for you p s disappointed with amazon delivery preordered phone took days after shipping to get delivered after shipping while an usual order takes days not an apple though revised review after months usage pathetic phone writing the review after a month s usage and phone works really fine and no lag at allpros display is really awesome with hz smooth and fast refresh rateoxygen os experience is awesomefast charging i e charges upto in minsvideo quality is great due to oiscamera quality has improved than the beginning due to the time to time updates by oneplusfingerprint reader and face unlock works fastmobile network and calling is really good in low network areascons no headphone jackbattery drains really fast when used continuously for long timefront camera doesn t seem to be mp and could be better with software updates i was totally devastated after i received the product as it was a defective one its getting hanged and switched off multiple times automatically and after all these stuff i dont kno whether my product will be replaced very very poor from amazon the camera quality is not expected from one plus this quality can be achieved in a k budget phone never expected this from one plus you won t survive in indian market if you do like that in nord using cheap hardwares many people were excited about one plus but this one is not upto the one plus standard so please don t buy i like that phone very much it is smooth good audio and video i missed one thing here is no audio jack today is day one will update our review in weeks day here is my review phone is super smooth first week i feel battery is dying to fast but there is an software which is now fixed with update now i am getting full day battery backup i play pubg alot with no lags and frame drop there is no issue with display like other people are saying about nord my experience is awesome with this phone first i was confused as review by youtubers but i can say this is best phone in this segment oneplus oxygen os is dam smooth with simple and clean ui camera works excellent and don t go with hype of blue marble it look like realme types grey color looks like flagship oneplus minutes full charging pubg is working good ping is also decent while playing what happened to oneplus it used to be role model for quality in phones right from start with oneplus x now we no longer can trust specs on paper selfie camera is one of the worst ever blurry pixelated images yrs old phone models in this range have better camera even making calls have issues with this phone there are bugs everywhere cant hear incoming calls even service could not fix the problem till nowvery poor quality in ever aspect total waste of money this is my last oneplus and never again will trust this brand with my money first of all this device is hyped with hell lot of expectations amzed with the features offered i pre ordered oneplus nord and waited days for the delivery after switching on my device i just have no words by seeing the yellowish tint on the display this is even more worse using in night times with green and purple tints at low brightness levels my oneplus t display looks much better compared to the nord the replacement is processed by amazon as they verify issue by arranging technician visit to examine my device first it s really a big disappointment thanks to amazon for looking into my issue i suggest ppl to reconsider before buying good phone best camera with many modes just after getting phone got a update warp charging was fast enough display was the highlight front camera was not soo good but it was okay with its quality got it delivered today on the whole it is the best buy mobile at a very reasonable rate i got a gb variant which was very fast i have got severe display issue with green tint on of left screen and the brightness is abnormall high on the left side no matter how good the phone is in other features but it s being a mid range premium phone at least this issue not expected i have ordered phones in which phone is completely alright no display issue and other has severe i tried to exchange the product but amazon is not supporting for the same edit thanks to amazon for processing the return with refund replacement could not be processed as the product is unavailable my nord was delivered on nd august after a week these are my reviews pros fluid amoled display and hz display rate gives the display exactly what your eyes need for a soothing experience did not experience the tint issue yet after using redmi note pro for more than years the advertisements are hell the oxygen os feels heavenly i bought the gray onyx version it looks really premium the mobile is really fast and smooth you will be genuinely impressed with the face unlock speed with this mobile the fingerprint scanner was also fairly fast i really liked the various ways you could customize fingerprint unlock animations the cosmos one is pure love my mom has oppo a and this mobile is smaller than that one this set feels surprisingly handy which really goes with the lightweight build of this mobile this is my first oneplus so the charging cable and the adapter really impressed me charging speed results done by me when the mobile was switched off and was at at minutes at minutes short of their claim at minutes at minutes again my first op so the alert slider impressed me as well not a pro gamer but this mobile has a fnatic mode for games yet to test what it actually does but my gaming experience was fairly good the zen mode i liked this touch a lot reminds us that there is a life outside of your mobile too go talk with your family and have a nice chat with them the reading mode again another thing i liked pardon me if these are common features in mobiles of this range i read a lot and i don t like ebooks much but even when you are scrolling down google learning about the life cycle or genetic composition of the coronavirus the black and white mode feels soothing to the eye neutral for camera which i know is a prime requirement for many please look into other reviews i am not a voracious camera user so my views on this would be unfair to you readers the only review i can give is that in low light while taking a photo if your hand shakes the picture comes a little hazy cons battery yes many people in the oneplus community have raised this issue as well i will just write down my issues if you use the mobile normally the mobile should go on for a day that is you will have to charge it once a day even if you play games the battery tries to handle itself and i would call that performance average however if you switch on hotspot battery drains like a flowing river downhill a mountain i have some tasks that i do in the laptop and i do not have a ethernet connection so this is an issue for me kindly keep this in mind you knew this was coming the mm jack that everyone loves although the speaker is loud stereo speakers would have been better not an issue for me but yes you can get better processors at this price realme x pro for example again not an issue for me but no sd card support the lack of sd card support and mm jack is becoming prevalent it seems i wish the frame wasn t of plastic but it is although the buttons are of metal conclusioni can not emphasize much how much i am liking this mobile if you like watching anime movies or even youtube the screen will feel like a bliss among the cons i have written i can still live with of them but the battery draining issue is the only reason i gave it stars my redmi note pro handled being a hotspot better than this mobile i don t know if it is possible to fix this by an ota update i sincerely request all users of op nord to check their battery backup you can comment below if you want to note all of these are personal reviews thank you for reading quite a long review you won t regret buying this that is for sure never thought oneplus brand can degrade this low on camera quality you will definitely be disappointed with the performance of both front and rear cameras instead of at the front and at the rear they should have given atleast on proper camera to do the job disappointed why oneplus why first let me clarify this nord does not have any disturbing tinge issues as hyped by the media a very slight purple color appears when you use it in dark with lowest brightness and that too looks good instead of disturbing and i am pretty certain that i will not be using that setting ever overall the product is really good the build of the phone is very premium main camera selfie cameras are very good macro is a waste though you can take better macro shots from the main camera itself i am not too fond of photography so i don t bother with it s presence absence oxyzen os as always is hz display battery warp charge makes it a very good product will recommend to buy this phone missing headphone jack might bother you if you are not using blutooth earphones but i am okay with it overall impression good phone if you get it for k gb ram variant dnt buy this phone half of the time u will face network problem in this phone it s taking too much time for surffing half of the time my colleague complaint about my no not reachable i have raised request for replacement but that executive visited and said everything is working fine we can t replace i am very disappointed with this phone if you are buying for camera then my suggestion is don t buy this phone because compared to one plus photos are getting blured in nord my nord journey with amazon jul pre ordered nord with jul recd pre ordered kit st git box include with a t shirt ar invite and stickers jul prebook nord gray onyx with aug received nord before open sell start now waiting for the mail containing the nd gift voucher code from amazon received new update oxygen os immediately after switched on the phone now i shared a quick review of my nord after hrs of heavy use pros oxygen os with latest android built quality is good with gorilla glass protection on both front and back u r not jerry that u rig everything so dont panic about built quality brighter display with hrs refresh rate quad camera setup with a good day light photography duel selfie camera light weight and easy to grip yrs of regular software updates and yrs of security updates battery backup is quite good g processor g is the winner in his segment both sim working fine sound quality is very nice working gine with bullet wireless z no connectivity issue no heating issue noticed during use w warp charger charging speed similar to op pro fingerprint scanner is very fast cons minor display issue a negotiable bar is visible towards front camera on extreme low light conditions or zero brightness condition not lucky nd time after received a perfect op pro with no display issue hope it will solve by software update as oneplus already mentioned it in their community page need improvement in low light photography on front camera all side pannel were made by plastice meterial so there will be a chance of some scratches in future if u use a case on it noticed some lines on the top side of the phone after applying creator case no dolby atmos no mm jack one updated feature in oneplus launcher setting i noticed in nord that is still missing on my op pro the media could not be loaded i found so many glitches in this phone instagram doesn t work properly the phone gets hung while using different apps it s not a fun phone at all i m totally disappointed for your information i still haven t inserted my sim cards for it to be this bad one of the best in segment don t get distracted by the screen tinting issue it s yhe amoled property which is nothing to do with the quality of the product and it won t be hamper your day to day usage you ll barely notice this unless you want to see it despite being mono speakey the sound it much louder and above all hz refresh rate with oxygen os is a total bliss and no other android will give you this heavenly experience the battery is draining a little quick but i think it s because of hz and maybe battery optimization will be done in future ota updates about cameras macto and depth cameras are useless as it s not the one that you ll use otherwise they are good watching on my one plus nord blue marbleit s buttery smooth device with oxygen os fingerprint reader is quick and fast more fingerprints doesn t recognise sometimesamoled fluid display hz is good and smooth viewing ankles on white background also showing reflection and rainbow effectvideo content viewing is awesome and enjoyable my old honor pro contents where having more natural colours alert slider very useful function all devices must have now haptic feedback on this device is on the better side no lag built quality is mix of plastic and glass as many youtubers say metal is always best yes it feels more premium in hand but i don t feel anything difference and normally use with the case glass finsish is awesome and it s very comfortable light weight in hand so that s my preference one hand usage rear camera clicks alternate best or normal it s a hit or a miss ois video footage is awesomeultra wide is steady and pretty cool digital mode giving some pink and greenish tint processing having error and glitches on many photos attached pics amazon reviews before this issue was not there but now after updates i noticed they can fix by ota updates one plus please fix this soon front camera not good in low light oil paint like image pink grainy updates came but still camera dept have to be fixedcamera photo processing takes seconds time not as fast as a flagship it s a midranger but below flagship depth cam is decent macro camera actually why they included this mp in this phone as that what k other chinese brands

one plus t was a much better choice but everything have pros and consrecent reviews of t was negatives on battery backupone plus is a trustable brand g more or less will take above half yr to come to india i will usa a device min yrsso hope this wont disappoint me geekbench single core multi corehappy with my nord device after using it for several days i noticed some issues image processing is taking time more than usual after clicking a image you need to keey your hand stable for a while otherwise the image will get blurred low light photography is very poor battery is draining faster even in hz refresh rate sometimes networks drops are there you ll lost internet connection for seconds and it ll restore after it but all of these issues can be resolved by update and oneplus is very concerned about their customers as they keeps asking for issues in their community page buy it if you re not a gamer or not into phography and want balanced and smooth device my review is after days usage of nord start with cons battery backup very less getting max hrs sot back cameras are total waste and slow motion video recorder some times flickers and very dull even in normal browsing phone heats up imagine while gaming what will be the phone temperature its above degrees dual volte never workspros fluid amoeled display awesome warp change full battery in mins approx look and finish is good i dint face any display tint issue usp of g but not even running at a level of g i m so frustrated of this phone being everything fast and snappy if you re restricted on connectivity all the fun fades away the network connection is so lost away its very hard to connect to the internet although its faster than the usual g but only after its connected i literally feel of breaking this phone several times a day this reminds me of very old tech products which used to work only when you slap or hit it hard pathetic its been more than a month i am using this phone and i was one of the happy oneplus user but last week we have got an update and after the installing the updates there is very serious network issue sometimes it feels like throwing the phone away my new phone as suddenly you cannot call anyone and your net also stops working i have written below mail to oneplus lets see till when we get an update until then i dont know how am i going to manage hi oneplus team there are a couple of issue that i am facing since the last update please note these problems were not there before the last update took place whenever i call anyone there is a full signal and suddenly after a while it runs out of network and shows an error also when on international calls it gets disconnected very often there is no error in sim card as it works well in other device even in full network showing g above the network i face loading error not only on google but any app even on whatsapp it is not able to send a hi and i have to reboot the phone to get it working again i request you to find a solution to this as oneplus is a very trusted brand and we as consumers do not expect such major problems from you device the media could not be loaded after using for hrs the screen got glitches all over the screenand also the shipping package wasn t packed with damage proof cartoon box it was just the phone under the plastic cover even the edges of the phone box were damaged following is my review of the device pros the display is amazing oxygen os is really clean good and easy to use the alert slider button is helpful charging is fast not as much as realme x pro but quite fast cons the camera is bad really bad only on daylighting the back primary camera can take good pics all the other cameras are useless in the back wide angle lens shoots really soft pictures you cant zoom or crop the picture or it turns grainy depth and macro are just place holders they are of no good use performance is okayish you won t feel any lag in normal usage but scrolling through twitter feed or google news feels starts showing lags and jerks camera after clicking the picture after shutter sound and a small image showing at the lower corner it still needs more second to click the picture properly you need to keep the camera in the same position even after clicking the pic for more second or the pictures are blurry speaker is not good high in volume but low in clarity if you push the volume for more than it starts cracking battery performance is not good either it requires another round of charging by pm without gaming but my phone is defective and has some charging issue not sure whether the battery performance is because of the same waiting for a replacement if you are ready to spend k and you really want oneplus device and are ready to sacrifice with the sub par camera setup then go ahead else try to look out for other devices almost everything you get under k price range oxygen os is the best android skin right now experiencing it under k is a deal breaker there are other smartphones with snapdragon series processors under k but not all of them are bloatware free except oneplus buy this phone if you love to have a nice ui great display good camerasabsolutely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a phone under kprovding a headphone jack to type c would have been very good oneplus nord and get st smooth famishing asswom pictures quality battery life good gb ram to gb g in ready greay colour nice photo quality assurance nice battery charging quick fast over all good price is high oneplus when the phone was delivered it s sound looks good but after a days it s speaker volume automatically goes low and day by day it s going low and low even on handsfree mode on full volume i have to take it to close to my ear to hear it i want to replace it but amazon not allowing for replacement i am totally frustrated after buy this phone one of my biggest bad decision to buy oneplus nord one of the useless phone i have ever seen there is several reasons behind my sentences there is no jack so u have to buy bluetooth earphone and bluetooth is not working at all it s not detecting oneplus earphones and if it s connected it will disconnect in few minutes go and search on google u will get lots of topic regarding this phone music quality is too bad on every earphone phone doesn t have sd card support so you can t take any backup directly to external memory what was happened to me and i lots approx contacts and huge amount of photos the mobile software has huge bugs and i am damn sure it was not tested properly mobile has plastic body seriously for what i paid this much amount backside chinese logo battery is too bad even it s not capable to run for full day i just want my money back and take this nonsense most irritated device i was purchased one plus nord gb gb version from amazon festival sale i got rs discount on my hdfc credit card but all this is trap to hold your money i was received the mobile next day after setting up all things it shows battery percentage till that time i used it approx min so i decided to charge it fully then plan to use all features so i charged it completely to started using it i use camera clicked some pics videos installed few apps after usage of only minutes it started heating so much even my moto g plus did not heat that much which is year older also battery drains sooo fast show will run only hourswhat a sit this is spending k for this sit guys stay away from this phone when i called customer care they agreed for replacement but they told our technician will check it i was firm on my decision for getting full refund don t want this sit they agreed even there technician was not physically checked the phone as they were aware about this scam i called it scam finally after couple of days i received my refund amount my personal request don t buy this sit while charging video calling simple net browsing separately there is no return replace policy for defective products as inspection guy says amazon will fetch money from his pocket if he allows replacement and amazon is not satisfied with the issue so indirectly no one will take risk to approve these internal issue as they are afraid what if amazon doesnt get satisfied like how i was not able to satisfy the inspection guy its all about inspection guys wish if he wants then only your issue will get resolved else you have to live with the defective product the camera quality of the product is pethetic not even compete with phone in the market don t purchase you will definitely regret about this now both amozon and one plus answer ing my calls not even able to return amazon not even provided me the cashback offer even after purchase of above never gona buy anything from amazon now onwards flipkart is best both in product and services they offered mobile overall ok but i m really disappointed with oneplus cheep publishing stunts for both budget tv and phone that s the reason for one star review camara is flicking when we take vedios of fire smoke i took videos pics on house warming all of them i took while yagnam were flicking and blure oneplus connect is not so usefull with the oneplus tv keyboard not opening when we play vedio audio and video are nonsync front cam also not soo good i like the fingrt print point and switch they could have give option to the user for wired headset cz in wfh times talking calls hours and hours don t think soo wireless ones will serve purpose the phone was hyped so much that i decided not to wait and pre book the device but to my utter dismay the day i received the device i noticed that the screen on dim brightness started flickering a bit upon which i raised the issue with amazon i thought that it was just some minor issue which the influencers were talking about and might get rectified with a software update the update did happened but the issue still remained but it didn t stop there to add insult to injury the phone automatically got formatted and all my data got lost i literally rued my decision of ordering the phone in a hurry choppychoppy choppysuch a bad choice if u r a gamerdon t but this plz go for redmi note proi bought it for performance and getting a better phone for gaming but i m very dissatisfiedeven the hz hz display is choppyno option for extreme graphic rendering whatsoever even in smooth settings in pubgdon t go for this line chipset i e gplz buy the phone with or above processor if u don t want to be disheartened like mei don t know what to do now after thiseven the connectivity issue i encountered was adding to this pile of complaintswhat good will g support will achieve when it s not even there for the next few yearsonly the screen amoled display nd the camera is worth the moneydon t buy gamersnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooeven the touch doesn t work sometimes u ll be shooting but the akm stops after few bullets this being the major turn down this might help someone and save their money don t decide to buy a phone on crapy paid youtube reviews think if they are given review unit those will be absolutely well quality checked and enhanced ones no company give crapy defective product to review and take down their own reputation only who spent money and bought to review them they review that product genuinely don t fall for so called company logo or crappy watermarks on pictures they captured which seems cool as every owner thinks which actually not they aren t worth your money don t rush and take newly launched phones always see user reviews and buy beware of fanboys yes this is important as many of my friends have this company product they feel themselves as brand ambassadors they think their mobile company is superior supreme just because they have spent more money for after all a chinese product now because crapy chinese product don t listen to those fanboys after all they are not your pocket but you are going to spend for it choose what makes you happy even k mobiles aren t bad you decide your mobile product not those product advertising people in your friend group now i tell my review about the unit i got pros slim sleek design good os wide diplay charging speed charged to within min handy haptic touch is very responsive good back cover no lagscons camera camera is not at all feels like oneplus camera as i used many oneplus phone s pictures of my friends though it has same camera specs of t and pro main camera i am referring to it doesn t click photos like them i feel my iphone se model takes better natural pictures than this poor low light pictures grainy and photos become filter applied at x at low light depth sensor won t detect edges properly marco is waste main camera colours are over contrasted front camera takes beautified pics even we don t use any filters not at all natural pics my iphone se old model s mp takes more natural skin tones than this camera it s like oppo beautified camera wide angle camera is good display pink tint issue was present more visible in google apps there was black bar visible extending from front camera notch hole which was so irritating it was visible in dark room in dark theme brightness below percent in light theme i could see screen fluctuations even though auto brightness is off hz is just a gimmick battery drains fast at hz so when i changed it to hz to save some battery it is so yuck lags are more works like gb ram android phone since i came from using my iphone se old model at hz which is way butter smooth even after using it for years this nord disappointed me build quality i got unit which had minor dent at its right corner osgood found some bugs like revert of settings to default after theme is changed so u need to change those every time u change the theme so irritating final opinion i returned this product amazon service was great k is not worthy for average processor bad camera average os average build quality average infact bad display if you buy this thinking camera is good you are fooled instead take t or realme x pro or k pro or samsung m or a they won t disappoint you think wisely don t fall for false useless advertisement gimmicks hope this helps you thank you have a great day well let s talk about the features and performance of the phone first of all i pre ordered this phone and it is my first oneplus device i am using it and the best thing i like in this phone is that the oxygenos which is buttery smooth and no lag and i was testing this device since week and the over all performance of this phone is very good only processor is a bit less like we should expect a flagship processor like snapdragon but in terms of pricing they choose g with g ready for future proof let s talk about the camera quality well i was testing the camera and it is lit trust me the colors and pixels are bright and good like daylight pictures are just fabulous for the gaming i don t find any lag issues or heating issues and the p recording is just smooth and stable i have tested the stability of the video and it is superb let s talk about the display now this amoled display is awesome and hz screen refresh rate makes everything buttery in terms of scrolling up and down and the haptic feedback is also great while typing let s talk about some cons could have go for snapdragon plastic frame doesn t make this phone premium no headphone jack overall i would rate this phone out of after reading other reviews i think most of the people here were looking for a flagship phone for a k price tag for me i ve been upgrading my phone almost every couple of years and that too from flagship to flagship i got nord after t and there s a huge difference in both phones i ll mention my pros and cons pros oneplus is a company that listens to it s customers there were minor bugs in the software which were fixed in an update i got after using the phone for a week the oxygen os feels fast compared to t paired with hz display and snd g people there are memory channel instead of which is usually the case in snd and travelling speed varies due to that the phone looks and feel premium as promised you wouldn t even feel the plastic body and unless you re super strong or a rough user don t buy this phone remember a time when almost every phone was made of plastic the display is a lot better than op t even though on paper they ve the same display the color density per ppi is higher in nord one of the underrated feature for op phones the phone is made in india even though the company is chinese it is still employing people in india and if you re not a target of increased unemployment rate lucky you the software is as fresh as it can get and i can t already wait for november to get always on display and android cons the camera is performing great but i m sure it s not flagship performance instead of complaining i can wait for updates and as you can see in pixel series software of the camera matters too after a week of usage i feel the battery is same as the t but as mentioned above android would most probably fix that that s it for me i think most bad reviews here are unjustified and doesn t give the a fair review to the phone people using mi or poco or vivo or whatever i don t think there s any company that listens to it s customers like oneplus does even samsung can t move brisby button even though everyone hates it look online and look for op ideas website the company genuinely cares about it s customer unlike most companies here you re paying for an almost flagship experience and the company delivers it exceptionally well hope my review was helpful and it helps you enjoy your new phone the phone is amazing in terms of experience customisation battery life and camera quality yes the rumours about camera quality isn t true and i m very happy with it however the seller and amazon showed a special reviewers edition on my order that i never received even after complaining to amazon customer care i was asked to contact seller and seller forwarded my query to amazon hence passing the buck not a great experience amazon is clearly cheating through the hdfc cash back bonus offer they mentioned if the total bill amount is more than k then there will be a discount of and a bonus cashback of however spite of my order size being more than k they are not giving the cashback saying that because with the discount of the total amount was less than k so we cannot pay the cashback of it clearly means that the bonus was applicable for bill amount of and not similar situation would have been of bonus cash back above lac where they were giving k of cashback this is clear case of cheating confusing the buyer although the phone product is very good too many bugs in the software even making a basic phone call or receiving a phone call is nit error free the basic utility of the phone itself has gone missing the screen issue is existing it s not noticeable in daily use only if you look for it you ll find it nevertheless shouldn t be existing to an extent where normal usage is hindered by it by far the worst iteration of phone by oneplus maybe the x was close to this in being bad cameras but not even one can produce decent results they saybits the same module as op but why is the result so bad from the main sensor looks like they are wantedly degarding the performance to sell op as well hz is present but not certainly sure if it helps as battery drains and have noticed couple if times the phone phone hearts up after a week if usage given that initial battery cycles might lead to extra heart dissipation the peak brightness of my t is higher than nord all in all look somewhere else not the right time to buy maybe few issues might be fixed with ota software updates but there many hardware issues on this like the screen battery and maybe the calling network issues so for time being stay away will update the review in future is ota updates solve them when you go and come back to low network area phone loses its connection with the network and never recovers need to restart the phone this is a major problem lot of my friends relatives started complaining that am not reachable for the whole day oneplus you need to work on this redmi note pro was far better than this camera quality is not up to the mark when compared to previous oneplus previous models and generates lots of noise bugs were there when i did start to record video using the front camera with a resolution of k fps and it got resolved once i updated to the latest os version green purple tint issue is clearly visible when you operate the phone in dark mode below brightness people who prefer gb gb variant must keep in mind that oneplus nord does not have an expandable memory slot so the best option would be gb or variant please use a good mobile case as the frame is made up of plastic which has high chances of getting damaged and it is not waterproof and dust proof certified gamers should not consider this phone as the battery drains out quickly and there is also heating issue chennai india i was worried about negative reviews on battery camera and display issues but i don t find any it delivers what is promised after hours of handling i wanted to write a quick review who are ordered and worried just like me because of negative reviews i pre ordered the oneplus nord g gray onyx gb ram gb storage after a long wait it was delivered today aug after years of oneplus i now finally upgraded to oneplus nord highly satisfied with nord i will post an update after a week s usage really good looking phone which feels premium in hand exept the sides which are made of plastic camera is awesome don t look the reviews their standards are way high for an average user you will definately get a flagship level experience performance awesome display is beutiful to look at the best thing about this phone is you feel good while writing something the touch response is top tier you will definately get phones much cheaper than this with better spec sheet but let me tell you having a oneplus phones feels good buying a mi or oppo phone of will still be mi and oppo phones as they are known for their cheap phones and oneplus phones last and i mean they last long i previously had oneplus x years old and it still works fine exept for battery hence you can easily use this phone for atleast for years that for me is good enough beware oneplus nord has serious network issues dual volte is not always working i am not able to recieve calls i tried with jio sim on both slots even tried using idea sim on one slot with g network tried different combinations changing primary and secondary sim s ultimately found that there is a serious network bug in the software or hardware and to solve this temporarily i am now switching on off airplane mode every now an then annoying i ve notified this in the oneplus community forum for more information regarding this issue search oneplus nord network issues in google one plus nord has some issues like google home search and as well as google assistant doesn t work some time and phone dial shows updating call recording were not getting saved very very bad performance i upgrade to my mi a that was brilliant mobile the one plus nord is bad performance and camera fully unclear photos front and rear camera also loved the device what oneplus said it delivered it s snappy and feels fast the screen is great i got sot day and it charged pretty fast as well poweroff mins poweron mins i did a little stress test from my end running multiple heavy applications and running benchmarks as well it s temperature increased only about quite impressive ufs is a drag and the cameras are overhyped they are good but not as advertised would suggest this phone to anyone coming from a mid range device and want a flagship like feel the closest competitors for this device are pixel a and iphone se lastly nord is an experience not just any other mere device you buy a descent mobile feels premium awesome display with hrz referesh rate fingure scanner lightening fast front camera clarity is amazing however back camera needs some software improvement especially for low light photography and portrait mode fast charging takes approximately minutes from to design could be better with camera module at centre or square shape camera module at top left better discharge faster overall a good mobile phone this is going to be a big review and is not about detailed specs that you can find anywhere online this is a completely user review so i have been using this phone for a week now and here are my observations an extremely well built solid hardware software very refined and polished you will like every moment of using it the display is awesome almost at par with samsung s super amoled displays videos in youtube netflix etc are super clear have high contrast and colours and super quality a mm jack is sorely missed you ned to buy a separate type c to mm for the headphone you need to click the mic button for the mic to work the mic also doesn t work with many earphones and those without the button may not work at all but the phone s built in mic will be used and the sound output is via the earphone i need to research more into this bluetooth headphones work great though i am using a cheap rs converter and the sound output through my sony akh boat earphones are mindblowing no loss in sound quality very high bass it becomes higher when you turn on bass bosst in the equaliser settings sound output through the speakers is awesome too it does not produce the tin can sound that most phones produce the sound output is really good even for small things like notification alert and ringtones and whatsapp messages the camera is absolutely fantastic it produces crisp real colour images with high detail in both front and rear cameras i am a very long time user of samsung flagship phones and the only good cameras are above rs k phones but still they produce unrealistic high contrast software boosted images that look great but not realistic the nord s camera is the best i have seen in any phone even better than iphones the battery is incredible too again coming from samsung flagships i never remembered the time i actually charged the phones more than minutes and had more than a day s worth of power the nord is better than that i charge my phone to in the morning and then connect to laptop wifi hotspot for around hours listen to music watch videos an hour of calls and continuous whatsapp skype use and the battery still shows next morning following the above point yes i have a couple of habits and always use dark themes kill all apps every single time before locking my phone have turned off all notificaions from most apps except whatsapp skype zoom messages etc have also denied permission of location etc for all apps until i actually use them and need location access bluetooth wifi nfc tap to wake lift to wake etc are always off i don t need them and it s disturbing to receive nonsense notifications i am a hardcore pc gamer and do not like to play games on the phone i had always got mindblowing battery backups from my previous samsung devices and the nord s backup beat every one of them that slider on the nord is a magic wand with my previous phones i had to unlock and then change profiles to ring vibrate and silence the nord has a point slider yes it is point and it took me a while to realise this as i thought it was point at first you can switch between ring vibrate and silent just by the slider there are options to set the display area to just below the front camera holes so they are not intrusive on the videos is awesome there is also an option of greyscale that turns the display and everything you see to black and white and this is system wide and also turns the video playback to black and white which i think is pretty awesome too this part of the review is biased my previous phones have all been samsung flagship devices note a and then note they are absolutely brilliant devices and i need to write a comparison for people who are thinking of switching the camera on the nord beats all of them is quality and real colour reproduction the nord s front camera is better than all the samsung device front cameras combined those were absolute garbage a little better than vga level cameras samung devices always have bad music quality even with the dolby atmos turned on and volume turned to max level the nord s music quality is far far superior even without touching the equalizer and the volume halfway up i never felt the need to use an s pen much on the notes and the thousands of software customisationsly that samsung offers they are mostly a gimmick and you wouldn t use them past the first weeks of purchase these features are not missed now the samsung flagship super amoled displays are better than nord s amoled display the whites on a samsung are milky bright white and the blacks are absolute deep blacks this was system wide the nord s blacks are greyish blacks and the whites are greyish too the reds on a super amoled is blood red and the nord s reds are crimson yellow ish similar with the blue colour if you are coming from an lcd or oled display you won t notice any difference but if you are coming from a retine hd or super amoled p p ppi plus display you are going to notice it for a very long time samsung s built in theme store is very sorely missed it was very exciting to change themes every days an have a complete system wide new look oneplus s software does not have themes third party launchers and theme apps even paid ones will only let you customise the lock screen home screen and the menu icons everything else will still look the same also the lock screen and home screen have nice contrast if you set an hd wallpaper the rest of the system has a grey ish black background if you set the dark theme and greyish white with the default theme i personally was a big fan of the old x keyboard layout that samsung has built in i am now trying to get used to the qwerty srtyle keyboard third party keyboards are not as smooth as the default ones although nord s keyboard has a cool feature of setting custom background images on the keyboard i do miss the mm jack i could connect the desktop to usb tethering or charging and still listen to songs while i work this is no more possible with the nord some third party converters have a type c and mm jack split in but it can only be used to slow charge the device and listen to music at the same time and not data transfer or usb tethering this was important to me finally about my decision to buy the nord so obviously i wanted to upgrade to a samsung flagship s series or note series device but the choices were all above rs k that too after applying exchange value and discounts the lite series for the note and s series samsung phones are all renamed lower end phones and have horrible cameras and other half baked features i also looked at lg s g x and they were selling at largely different rates at different websites and it was untrust worthy moreover all of the flagship phones are at inch display sizes or larger i hate large displays that i couldn t operate with one hand and are not just practical for a primary device i feel a inch device is the perfect size the nord is bigger than that but fit in one hand well all the other features fit the bill perfectly i was not ready to shell out rs k and above for a phone i wouldn t use to it s design and hardware capacity and intent and i was getting the nord at rs k after exchange of my old phone i am very happy with my purchase and it was very much well worth it i have played around with the phone tweaked a lot features and found the complete package far better than flagship devices from other brands i bought another nords for family members and they are happy with the devices too over all i am happy to be the owner of oneplus nord but below some negative points please must see before buying if you are heavy userfingarprint reader is ok but not best camera is not upto mark for k mobile useless cameraif a say about battery life than its not good if you are using with h screen refresh rate but battery is decent good if using with h refreshrate and dark modei am not a heavy user but battery running for one day after doing settingsif accidentally it is dropped due to plastic frame it will brake down not durable this is a normal daily driver from oneplus not so good not so bad pros good design feels premium even though the body is plastic good performance no lag observed good call quality and music quality on headphones compared to my oneplus good signal reception and wifi speed does not feel too heavy in hand and does not feel slippery with the case provided smooth uicons camera this is is biggest negative of this mobile i am not sure if it is the hardware or software but it is bad i feel my oneplus produced better pictures with main camera i do not see good colour reproduction pictures appear little dull and low light picture is grainy my family member s oneplus t is much better compred to nord s main camera there is a huge huge difference in picture quality between t and this i don t know what oneplus have done here selfie camera is also not good oneplus t produces much better images so if you are a photo freak this is a big no for you hope oneplus fixes it through software update i am not much into photography with mobile so i am fine here even though little disappointed screen is not up to the mark amoled with hz disaply really again i can compare it with oneplus t and it looks better when playing games videos or photos battery drains faster without actually doing anythingoverall i do not feel this meets the standard set by oneplus they have cut corners heavily mainly camera and screen this is just good enough as a daily driver nothing great i have gone for oneplus mainly for its support for good range of lte frequency bands which can be used in countries like usa compared to others in same price range you will have better options for the price if your main concern is camera and you do not travel much to foreign countries update after recent software update camera is better and battery is not draining as before looks like it is improving giving star it s really a cool premium mobile with great camera quality battery life and other such basic and additional features which makes the phone look alike a flagship it s charging speed and connectivity options are a little bit faster than the last year s flagship from oneplus the oneplus pro i m using both the phones and compared them practically the major thing that made me to give is the ui it s similar to the google ui which gives you a moto experience that s the only thing that i disliked other than that it s really a great mobile at a great price i feel like nord is little better than the pro other than the ui at half the price of pro reviews after using phone days pros premium build quality you will feel it awesome look touch very smooth fast full charge in hour and everything is working fine like gaming email office works calling ane other apps rear camera excellent detailed picture quality gb ram other than gaming you will feel it while transferring heavy data from one folder to other in seconds cons little bit heavy phone weight ftont camera is same as other one plus and samsung phones if someone using oppo vivo poco phn then he will feel front camera is not clear because it s show real image not filtered phone width is little less in mm as compared to other op phones review updated as of march worst phone on nord category please do not buy g will not work properly when i say properly it works in hours so choose carefully by chance if you buy please do not update the version once you upgrade the version you are dead on g only edge that too god knows there is no zero star hence had to settle for star worst oneplus model please ignore the update given below aug received the product today my few cents pros the processor is superfast and touch feel is really awesome back camera is like any other k phone camera good but front camera quality is good during vide calls build design is good and the new os features are also good not gone thru all of them the ones that are explored are good battery charged in the morning am after hours at pm left which means it might come for day since the setup operations takes lots of juice you can judge on your own cons fingerprint setup is pathetic the old fingerprint sensor is way better then this on screen one you have to literally scroll your finger in all dimensions for about times before it completes the setup its lame in terms of technoligical advancement fingerprint recognization is okay not as good as the old sensors in t and other oneplus models this phone is just amazing all features in one phone at this price nothing less than a flagship phone surely you can go for it with closed eyes very worst phone don t buy iam facing network connection issues while talking it is going into hold n recording starts automatically whatsapp call not at all responding very very worst phone after few updates iam facing these problems one month after iam giving my feedback don t buy this phone waste of money display tint issue is there display turns pink and green on low brightness in dark mode many set backs except it s camera nord is nowhere near justified for its price network disconnects mainly its internet frequently battery drains super fast calculator is worst touch sensitivity distinctions voice recognition abnormally wakes up to any soundi hope you see this review minute functions matters which shouldn t be overlooked oneplus created the hype and asked people to prebook it i prebooked on th july and then again on th july and received the product on th august i mean then why that prebook drama after that the phone comes out to be an average phone they claimed that it has flagship level camera trust me k phones click better photos above all that no clarification on prebooked benefits and how to claim shame worst phone didn t expect this from a reputed company like oneplus there is a major network issue with the phone and many are facing the same issue call is not getting connected and neither recieving calls have changed my sim into a different phone and found that there is no issue with vodafone network and working fine oneplus team please fix this issue sooner else this model will be a dud feel bad to buy this instead of this i had many options but i trust one plus despite all this the nord has nothing extraordinary all these features we can get in k k range i bought one plus nord on last month but i feel bored bcz ofhang in versionmany times fingerprint sensor do not work so i unlock with passcodebattery life is too short for internet user as full charge ends in very few hoursonly good thing about nord is fast chargeoverall feel disappointed i personally feel that this is a very good product in this range the battery lasts almost for two days with average usage no gaming involved camera quality is good unless if you want to go and zoom it till the last pixel not sure why you want to do that as the inbuilt camera software tries enhance the image and fails in doing so only in case of full image zoom else the image quality is great at this range sound quality is good overall its a good product for daily use for everyone the phone arrived the next day and i found it really smooth and interesting pros awesome display fingerprint sensor on screen lightning fast battery charging warp charge literally no heating while playing heavy games the gray ash finish prevents fingerprints sound clarity is real goodcons no headfon jack camera has a yellowish tinge upon stock experience once updated will be fine but u can still see the tinge camera could have been a bit better specially the wide angled lens all features are ok nothing exhilarating nor poor performance is ok processor is not a toofan processor hangs sometimes battery life is average however warp charge helps only if u plug it to w charger screen though good lacks sunlight readability speakers get the job done camera is good os lacks many intelligent features that make life easy no music compass app calculator app is sluggish n lame uses googles dialer and calendar app lame again oneplus should have invested in proper apps with intuitive features its software which is more disappointing than the hardware it s not what every youtuber is saying it s absolutely not like the magic oneplus one was the other two siblings of oneplus nord i have used as my secondary devices were oneplus c and oneplus t and both were amazing devices and are still with me nord is light weight good looking phone with ordinary amoled screen and speaker i am not a gamer so it doesn t matter how it performs there no complaints from camera either but nothing great about it too i also made a mistake of buying it in blue color it s so jarring that it started irritating me in a day another blunder i started using blue sandstone case and i felt like throwing up now it s in black color sandstone case and looks okay so i suggest buy its black grey color there is no option of returning it unfortunately and if you are coming from iphone don t even go close to it you will hate it the way i do phone is ok but some drawback after one month usage i am writing this review finger print reader is ok ok battery life is short but also charges faster main camera quality is ok zoom quality is ok front camera is bad pixels gone busted when you zoom the imagesfacing hardware problems like hanging the apps and stops working not good for multitasking overall just ok not as good as described no automatic call recording option nice phone camera also good and oxgen os and display is the main usp of this phone pubg gameplay is good but it supports smooth ultra fps that s the only con but in ultra graphics u got of time fps lock which is good and oneplus said that they are talking with the tencent for extreme graphics hopefully waiting nice phone overall thanks the look and feel is very good the phone is very compact handy and also felt light weight i was previously using asus z and vivo z x first time user of oxygen os and i am loving it no unwanted ads and apps butter smooth performance there are a few facebook related apps which can be deleted by connecting the phone with laptop u can find this info in xda developers website the g processor does a decent job i play games pubg and coc for about hours a day and was spending more time on the camera for the past days battery drains fast as i have nothing else to do other than fiddling with this phone all the time once the work life becomes normal the battery should be enough for day as of now am charging for times a day charging is fast with the w charger i am a fan of black colour and first time i purchased a different colour the blue marble i was initially thought of canceling the order to swith the colour to gray onyx later thought i can try something new good that i did not cancel the order the blue marble is fantastic and gives a premium look for those who expect a very fast shutter speed and image optimization dont go for nord it normally takes about seconds for the image to optimize and then display the actual image in portrait mode in nightscape mode it will take about seconds i dont mind waiting for or seconds though there is a blink in slow motion videos when you are in low light but i think it is the case with all the phones the pictures are very nice i am sharing few pictures here the mp macro lens could have been removed there is no use of it as far as gaming i did not find any lag or heating issue if u r going to use the plain case that comes with the mobile then u might feel a slight discomfort playing pubg display is very nice i did not have any tint issue with my device or may be it was fixed with the recent update that was rolled out goodreviewing after one week usagein hand feel is good back gorilla glass protection feels good in hand mobile signal strength is good ear piece volume is quite adequate can be heard while you are outdoors on road and noise around hz refresh rate is good oxygen os is clean and bloatware freecharges super fast takes me around mins from to i don t know if that s causing any long term harm to the battery opportunities of improvementbattery life is average i get hours of onscreen time with full charge my usage is mostly whatsapp email couple of upi payments in a day mins of youtube videos screen brightness in outdoors if you get a call when outdoors and it s sunny you almost cannot see who called you have to do some guess work and swipe down on screen to take callspeaker quality is substandard c mon oneplus this is a rs phone you definitely could have spent a little more on the speakers it sounds horrendous no headphone jackonscreen finger print scanning is slow fails couple of times before you can actually get in camera my daughter s k phone takes better pictures than this one i m not a big fan of large megapixels etc but you can see the photos taken on this phone are not great quality macro lens is useless they have cameras just for the sake of calling it quad camera phone setup again for the price range camera set up is substandard g though it s not in india yet why does this phone cover only one g band performance snapdragon g with gb ram sounds really good on papers my years old iphone plus gb ram performs much better even with a ios update i always feel apple should teach the rest of the tech world what optimization is response from oneplus support on battery life was not so great they asked me to remove all apps and reinstall them overall it s a great feeling phone on paper would work fine for day to day use but definitely not worth k just after using one day the phone os crashed had to boot to the main menu using power n volume button i didn t update the system after installing new apps from play store system update is that a reason to blame if so y can t it be made forceful for a k phone the hand experience by improving the build quality s expected one plus s more solid i feel used it for days by now and not happy with the purchase not a value for money thing i am a professional with average usage no gaming no video streaming generalized basic apps then too the phone drains battery and heating up every usage which is more than of min even during audio con calls for min or above it drain battery and heating up the biggest drawback as i mentioned above but there few more here not a great camera phone but i didn t required either so decide as per your requirement feel lagging in apps based on graphics usage no fast charger with box but charger is ok not an smooth performer and speed of operations keep vairing processor is of low capacity pros oneplus branding premium look and good aurgonomics display is quite satisfying but you could get a much better in same cost finger print scanner is quick sturdy and clean oxyos verdict if you are not bothered about the brand name as i than never buy this and you could get a far far better phone in brands like redmi vivo or realme go for those and don t feel compromised the media could not be loaded loved the size and weight of the phone the metallic finish and slim body makes it feel top of the world for such a budget phone packed with multiple features that i shall be exploring on the go the back cover is quite decent but okay but the most important fact is it has a waterproof protection over the charging point which is the best part from a usability aspect above all the picture quality is very natural and most importantly just like iphone without any additional filters that takes away the charm other than than that it is paacked with multiple camera features that ll blow your mind most importantly the broad smile and happiness over my daughters face was priceless what else could a proud dad expect from such a valueable product giving this review after months of usage very bad front and back camera with very bad battery backup although it is fluidic fast but these cons make it an average phone had high expectations from one plus but they are a total let down battery backup doesn t last you even half a day all day i am on battery saver mode still the battery ends by evening hz refresh rate is just a gimmick nothing special about it camera pics are awful both front and back a normal redmi phones click better pictures than this one avoid this phone the moment you unbox this device you will feel this is a high tier device one cannot easily find out that its made of plastic with gorilla glass protection the device is sleek and looks premium i do like the slight gradient on its back the camera bump is quite pronounced and definitely requires a casing which can prevent from smudges and other issues it runs on android out of the box as expected for any modern android device currently available the experience is smooth without any stuttering g does performs well coming to the displaydisplay is neutral and not overly saturated as compared to the oneplus that i have but i must say the display is extremely well optimized for true to life colors my oneplus kills the details when i run hdr videos which is not the case here you will see the details and the texture well preserved in the nord as compared to op hz is becoming the new norm for even in an entry level android and thats something which adds up to the smooth ui of the device since i do have a k as well handy the display of this device is no less vibrant and is vivid another important criteria for me is camera its well balanced camera the main camera borrows the same camera sensor i e the imx from oneplus which inturn has been used in the previous years oneplus series the colors are punchy gets you through most situations without hassle i do not use the macro sensor which is an utterly useless megapixel camera wide angle does its job well and thats an mp you do get depth sensor for portraits portraits are good if not the best the night mode is improved as well compared to previous oneplus the selfies are a tad softer and i feel it can be little sharper these companies force the skin smoothing on us but some of us do not like this and would like to disable probably there could be an option which am yet to explore the wide angle in front camera is a nice addition for group selfies coming to the audio is good the loudspeaker sounds decent its not a dual speaker on this front but a bottom firing single speaker which does it s job the most painful part of today s devices which is almost like a plague is removal of the mm jack i dont know whats the real difficulty in adding a tiny little port my oneplus has a mm jack ans yet it maintains a slimmer profile than the nord its an annoying experience to carry around type c to mm adapters and not that u have too many good choices for a type c earphones not all of like those bluetooth earphones which are quite a trend these daysso i do not have much to say about gaming am not a gamer hence i cannot comment on this but most likely the phone will be able to handle games like pubg asphalt without hickups as seen on other tech reviews moreover g model processors are wel optimized for games with higher clock speed set thats pretty much that i use on a phone i had options like redmi k pro and also realme x superzoom k pro is definitely a device to consider if you are ok with an year old device but u do get a flagship grade processor which is a powerful option as compared to g but u lose out on g if u really care for which we are not ready yet u do get risinf camera which could be a concern in long run but the non pro k with us is still doing fine and few do not like the miui but miui does have its own perks i do like the option of lockscreen wallpapers which change frequently from the mi library and the content is rich the k camera can be better optimized is what i feel realme x super zoom on other side is also a well packaged device however i wanted to go for a device with a amoled since i do a lot of media consumption on my device where as the x had an lcd and one cannot get deep blacks and contrast on an lcd most importantly i have been a longtime user of ghe oxygen os in simple words it s the no non sense ui and just as good as the google s vanilla android ui its blazing fast updates get rolled out as soon as google releases at last i had to chose a blend of everything for the money that i pay and nord was the device that fullfilled this so in nord you have gb gb variant k which is coming in september gb at k and gb at k at k increase i was getting a gb additional ram and double the storage which made sense to choose this over other two variants so who is this device for i think its for some one who wants a flagship grade camera a good punchy display for media consumption and social media but do not really wish to spend k plus but still get a flagship experience with few compromises in processor which is not a flagship but can still get you a snappy performance at a much lower price you are also future proofed with this device ready for g this phone is good but few things disappointed me please see the following matrix given below build quality it does not have the metal frame display compared with samsung j amoled display it is not up to the mark i liked the samsung s display because of color reproduction and quality battery operating system camera eventhough it has mp with quad cam setup pictures are not detailed it a average camera even after the software update specially mp macro lens sucks video quality is very nice camera app user experience is not exciting processor because its futuristic g color distrotion with change in viewing angles on white bright screen and its look like a cheap display also able to see the same color shift in the middle of the screen to yellowish pale affecting my daily usage even the night mode is turned off check your device guys and replace refund if you face the same issue thanks to amazon refund policy you are paying k not for such a cheap experience display touch is really good battery life is also good for normal users like me who use hrs screen time in a day i am easily able to draw hrs with a full charge camera is good though it can be improved real quick charging fingerprint reader is fast with lots of customization you will see lot of new features when you switch from an android phone like app drawer hidden apps wifi mobile data mode etc after months of deliberating over which phones to buy i decided to with the help of people complete my purchase of the one plus nord got it on the th of march and amazon delivered it speedily the next day morning so for the delivery the packaging was good and secure again kudos for the packaging truth be told i was quite excited for the one plus device i knew it was not a flagship phone but still i wanted to go for something worthwhile while were beyond my budget the one thing i had to settle for is the nord only the gb gb version was available to me all colours i went for the grey onyx ash one looked subdued to me and blue one looked quite bright even though it wasn t a flagship it doesn t feel like i am using a midrange phone i shifted to this device after four years of using mi a while i loved the stock android experience of mi a i am more in love with the ui of nord like all the reviews tell oxygen os is one smooth ui compared to the miui and other uis it updated to android almost immediately even though nord came with android out of the box with two years of updates and three years of security updates promised this looked and still looks a promising phone it s been two days since i received the handset and i have been testing it throughout the day the device comes with apps like amazon facebook instagram and netflix pre loaded but it is okay these software are used day to day anyway what s more important is the os doesn t come with unnecessary bloatware i got the gb ram variant so let s say speed is awesome obvious operating the phone is quite smooth also has the gb variant so lots of storage i loved the display the most standing at inches the displays sports vivid colors with a hz amoled screen it gives you a flagship like feel one plus has not made any compromises here the haptics are awesome scrolling is smooth and it is such a joy to watch netflix or play games on this phone i would give the display a on did i mention games yes we can play games here but make sure you get at least the gb version gb is better two days i have played harry potter hogwarts a mystery township real cricket nfs no limits asphalt the first two do not require a lot of graphics capabilities so it will work smoothly even in the gb variant the other three require graphics and storage so anything gb is better i played these games on the highest settings i also had multiple apps running in the background there were no lapses the games did not hang or played slow it was smooth the hz display made it look awesome as well the snapdragon g processor is really great to have while you play games the device did not show any signs of heat until i consistently played it the whole afternoon even then only so slightly there s a gaming mode which subdues notifications there s also a fnatic mode which is a pro gaming mode i haven t tried that out yet so i am a little confused about the feature so to speak but once i do figure it out i will let you know for gameplay i would rate this device there s a dark mode in this device there s also a reading mode which has both mono and chromatic lens effects if i had gotten some other midrange phone i d have purchased a kindle but now i don t feel the need this phone has an excellent reading mode it won t compare to the kindle paperwhite per se but it does the trick there s also a zen mode for keeping away from distractions there s also something called work life balance which doesn t let you allow notifications for a certain time period similar to zen mode but also different i will let you know once i actually try them both out performance on this device is ultimate the device is fast but that might also be because of the gb ram i have scrolling through the app drawers is fast and smooth i will rate this a phone display has corning gorilla glass protection as far as i know the phone has no ip rating but i surmise it is safe from drops of water sweat rain etc display comes with a pre applied scratch guard but it is prone to fingerprint smudges and dust fingerprint reader is pretty fast and accurate there s face unlock as well which is fast too coming to the battery life the phone has a mah battery with heavy usage i got hours of battery a day but if you are not gaming the whole day you might get up to a day s worth at least hours there s a battery saver mode which you can also schedule that would save you more battery but yes for this price i was quite disappointed with the battery it is not bad pretty average i d say would be my rating i expected at least a mah on this one at this price regardless of the average battery life the phone comes with a w warp charger which charges the battery in about mins to hour which is fast and awesome this is a good trade off i think you can charge the battery quickly coming to the camera the phone a quad camera to the rear a sony imx the main mp camera is great but not as good as the flagship phones like one plus or even t pro but it is pretty great it has ois too which is awesome it captures colours very well the second ultra wide camera mp does its job but it is only decent at best the other two cameras mp and mp are average actually it would have better if they were not there the macro is not as good as can be expected the depth is not so good here i would have liked a telephoto lens here but at this price i think the rear cameras are decent at best and the company did overhype it during launch you re better off using the main camera for everything to the front one plus nord sports a dual camera primary is mp and ultra wide at mp the selfie cameras are better than the rear cameras the primary one does the job well with the ultra wide not far behind as far as videos are concerned the rear camera does k videos at fps and p videos at both fps the front cameras do both at fps the cameras do a great job at recording videos however they could have been better for the camera quality i would give it a if you re into photography you might want to consider a different phone i mean this does the job but if you aren t a hobbyist you might want to consider something else i will update this review after a month and then three months to let you know more dbut i will definitely recommend this phone it has the best spec sheet for a midranger one plus has made little to no compromise and the phone does make you feel premium this is all what you expect from a smartphone everything seems really perfect the cellphone feels more premium that what we actually pay for it the user interface is really smart and snappy and it feels really nice while using the cellphone this is my second oneplus device and i am really happy with it the camera is really impressive don t go with the negative youtube reviews it is really a flagship camera and you would love every single shot captured through it the hdr is perfect and the edge detection is really impressive and trust me the night mode is really ultra amazing the only problem is that i just expected the battery to be bit more long lasting it is not that bad but it s not that good either but it gets charged quickly so it s not a big deal for me as well but on a regular usage i think the battery performance is not that good and that s the reason i m giving it stars instead of i could really say that you can choose oneplus nord over oneplus or pro because there s not much of a difference in both of them personally i ve compared oneplus and pro in real life with my nord and i still think nord is worth every penny and you could skip on or pro and go for the oneplus nord anytime hi i m using gn variant since month don t waste your money cons bluetooth issue even after few updates getting location icon in status bar even after location is turned off it s a serious issue every time i need to restart my phone to fix this issue phone gets heat if u use it while charging after using the phone for few days may be within days you will fell the lag in screen sensitivity even if we run it in hz call connectivity issue if u r using internet calling option even though if your network is full and internet speed is in mbps your call quality will be worst battery discharges easily few gestures are not working properly after update might be because of software issue in rear camera last are utterly waste even after updates finger print reader is good but sometimes it lags to open conclusion if you are thinking that you struggled a lot to earn money and if you know the importance and value money then don t go for it if not its left to you if you think you got money from somewhere and somehow without any effort and if you feel k is just nothing i m feeling about myself that i would have use this money to buy some other phone might be samsung a or apple s iphone se this is my fourth one plus phone and i was always a strong fan of the brand till this buy still having a one plus absolutely running fine with me but this device nord was a shocker i have received a used repacked item as in images from seller darshita electronics the cable looked really different and of local quality for a device worth k images of my t cable with dash engraving and this local cable in images there had been intermittent connectivity issues and network goes off completely at times with my airtel connection the adaptor connection with the mm jack fails through the call but the same adaptor works fine with my t the speaker volume varies in call and while listening awful camera the xiaomi phones under k gives you better images the finger print reader works fine at times and creates all pain otherwise my personal opinion on the usage of days absolute waste of money and a product to spoil the brand image i lost my k for fingerprint sensor it has a great job and battery life could have been better lets wait until the next update but the major i got dissapointed is its front camera though it has sony mp camera it takes a picture like mp camera or mp camera i didnt like it that much though i am not a camera user still for mp sony camera it could have done miraculous job i guess and coming to back rear camera i felt its good but still for sony mp camera it can do much better job i hope that in the future updates they may change all the camera performance both rear and front lastly the smoothness i loved it the way they have made it is incredible and its very handy too but one thing that is lagging is the price is too hectic for mid range but still i loved it except for cameras and battery life you can buy it eye closed those who wants to buy this phone he or she should know about cons of this mobile too because no one talks about cons and this mobile have serious issues that might be important to you the very serious issue is that about bluetooth it has been months since this phone is launched and they haven t done anything about this the issue is bluetooth doesn t work properly in this and this is annoying because it doesn t have headphone jack that s why we must have bluetooth headphones bluetooth automatically disconnects but doesn t connect automatically again you have to go in the settings and connect it manually this disconnection happens in every mins literally how can they make this phones with many issues atlast if u want to buy it you have to know its cons too packing soft amazon price ae discount touch very smooth camera front not good very disappointed by oneplusback need improvement like filters and autofocus have some bugs purchase advise think again phone is good but service from one plus is not as expected not good and not fulfilling expectation after buying this phone i need to submit it one plus care center twice first for the hitting issue poor network issue and few other problem after getting phone from one plus care center in next one week i need to submitt phone again for same network issues one plus care center is not able to resolved network issues their enginer said network issue is going to reslove after first update comes in future but not able to resolve it at present there are some tecnical issues not all new nord phone have same issue that i am facing in my phone it s only around months old phone and in warranty period also they want me to use this defective phone having network issue my calls are getting droped not having proper network not able to have internet properly two sim card not working properly at the same time one plus care said it s problem of vodafone they just blem on service provider i had checked and found having problem in cell phone in stead of service providers like vodafone idea jio aritel since last days my nord phone is in one plus care center but not getting any clear solution for the same since phone is in warranty period and if they are not able to resloved it then they need to replace it with new device which has no problems as this kind of problems are not seeen in each newly launched one plus nord phone worst service i have face till now from one plus not acted as per brand name i have high hopes with one plus i am writing this review after day of use first of all the battery charging is really mind blowing and can charge the full battery between minutes camera quality is good and good stabilization providing a premium feel in videography low light photography is the place we need to improve i believe sometimes i think this phone is overpriced but the oxygen os experience will remove that thinking from our mind the phone got delivered today it was quite a long wait as it was a preorder i bought this phone for my father and playing around with it i guess this would be the best option for him he s an enthusiast photographer enjoys video and movies on youtube a lot of multitasking and calls going through the day the phone feels light in hand not something bulky though the structure is plastic but holding it in your hand or looking at it trust me you won t get the plastic feel the fingerprint scanner is too quick and responsive charging was quite fast to in minutes the display is superb clear and hell smooth thanks to hz speakers are loud too produces a crisp and soothing sound please dont expect the performance of high end speaker the camera is good captures a good amount of details in both mp and mp mode the colours feel natural autofocus was nice too as per the price tag but definitely not what they advertise it as one plus camera the camera needs more tweaks macro and depth sensor is ok nothing great or to be proud of note heavy gamers this is not for you if you are looking something for long term thanks to one plus for this but yes gotta go you guys did overhyped the promotion a good strategy must say worst battery life it is not even withstanding a day thogh only used for minimal usage never gone for gaming video streaming still battery drains drastically i need a replacement another big drawback is heating issue heating for normal seconds call i have never faced this issue in my earlier phones verybad experience with nord disappointed lot of hypes in the phone it is normal another phone with g technology don t know about g compatibility only we know when started using g they sold and earned profilt only camera quality is good hi team greetings of the day this is to bring into your kind notice that i bought one plus nord gb ram on th december further by using the phone for a month i understood that the phone is having heat issues example if you start using the phone for a call within mins it gives a tremendous heat which is unbearable at your cheeks i learnt this recently couple of days ago hope you do understand the concern now and looking forward for your kind support towards the resolution as i understand that this product is a faulty piece which made my heart shattered and feel like lost the confidence in the brand read this review before buying oneplus nord review after using the phone for days pro s oxygen os best os after ios display is good fluid amoled hz the speaker is loud and clear alert slider comes in handy the phone is really good to hold warp charger future proof with g updates the camera quality is good both front and back after the update battery life is good for non gamers fingerprint sensor and face unlock works really well con s amazon s delivery got the phone delivered after weeks no headphone jack but understandable given that tws is the future tint issue though not a major problem but can be seen in dark conditions the phone is good but i would advise you to wait for realme x pro and poco s nord killer compare them with nord before you take your decision have a good day all rumours like green tint display issue at low light condition battery backup is less takes more time to charge were absolutely wrong oneplus lovers can go for it without any second thought tested almost days to give exact review display is good hz refresh rate is awesome no tint issue at all brighness levels loudness of speaker is good no stereo charges less than an hour warp charging good battery backup almost a day without gaming only issue i faced is with oneplus z series bluetooth headset gets disconnected in between calls and audio playback hope this will also resolve soon this phone is perfect for someone who uses it for casual use like facebook whatsapp and some games and other apps and nothing intensive and with some pictures here and there built wise camera speakers display mine had no tint issue battery could be optimised with updateso if you are not a very heavy user than just go for it phone feels very good in hand with a perfect weight balance although pubg runs fine with smooth ultra but i played only tdm xd it says dual volte support but as of date it doesn t have dual volte support simulataneously on both sims if network is on in one sim and you get call on another sim you can t access internet and the second sim remains switched off screen resolution is also not upto the mark customer support is also very bad the options which you get in budget redmi phone is far better than this i suggest not to buy this model it lacks many simple to simple options a phone at a cost of can t expect a dummy the front camera is pathetic blurness in photos like ordinary low quality pictures its not worth giving k for blur photos which is basic need of everyone for front camera photos whether its day light or low light its too bad sad to see oneplus degrading its brand image by creating such a hype on this phone and manufacturing such poor quality i think oneplus forget to test the camera before launching it or they just want to bluff the customer by name u can get more good camera phone in this rangerear camera is good macro is pathetic its like vga camera in day light condition rear camera is good but in low light poor quality you can go for other phones in this price range for better experience in photos battery drains too quicklysoftware is good bed product and performance no return policy not happy to this product this is really not as per oneplus standards the phone restarts randomly every now and then the network coverage is very bad often people tell me your phone is not reachable but when i see the network bar it shows no issue problem with jio network in my area jio coverage is very good but this phone often shows no jio network i need keep switching flight mode to regain the network these r two main issue with the phone and no body is writing about it network and restarting i have purchased gb and gb storage just days before and found lots of issue on it else i was using realme x from last years was the outstanding device for me till now i have faced no issue it stuck on application i have faced so many time that application stuck on somewhere without any reason mostly youtube and whatsapp in display fingerprint is not quite worth it it much delay than realme x some time it take me to touch times otg support but not more than tb i have tb and i used it well in my realme x but not in this while it is k costly than that camera if i copair it to realme x my x was outstanding in camera it is ok but can t compete that one charging is same as realmex while it was comes with watt and it is watt there is no use of much ram if application experience is not so smooth heating issue it was quite major and disappointing last night i was on normal call and put on charger for min tried to get some power to make call continue it was started heating i felt well in my ears it is flagship segment phone and i was not gaming on charge so it was so bad for me i would like to return if possible i am not sure but it might be a device issue as well i hope oneplus will understand my concern on a serious note i am collecting evidence for future proof thaks an awesome phone for the price simply great the camera is not that bad as described by others and in review videos if you are planning to buy a phone with a budget of upto k go for it no other brand gives you a variant for this price the phone is awesome you wont feel the difference between a flagship processor and this one while using this phone has a heating issue with the way the publicity of this phone was done it doesn t even meet the basic standard even while using chrome and instagram the phone gets abruptly heated that it even becomes difficult to hold it its been just months since i am using the phone and the company refuses to give a replacement let s start with the display of the phone one plus display is the better example in mid ranges phones range and camera is just as awesome as any other one plus phone and talk about gaming with the nord was a good experience though don t mistake it for a gaming phone some d and lower end d titles can easily hit the fps mark you d be happy playing ball pool or clash royale on the nord however heavier games such as real racing and fortnite do show some performance issues firstly stutters are more frequent in high action moments such as gunfights in fortnite secondly frame rate drops occurred more often in games that rely on cpu intensive features and if we talk about battery of one plus so battery backup is never an issue with one plus because it comes with warp charger which takes your battery from to in just minutes and lastly its price i bought this awesome piece at from my icici amazon card by which i get cashback so if you want to buy one plus and your budget is lower than k then just go for it i am very much satisfied with nord and it ticks all the checkboxes for a daily driver it is smooth clutter free fast and takes avg to good photos hz amoled is jus brilliant for this device that makes the user experience to an another level overall in with this mid range segment difficult to choose another phone other than nord thanks oneplus and amazon oneplus nord is by far the best budget smartphone right now with some flaws pros good display amoled is always good good performance oxygen os is awesome fast charge is amazing fingerprint reader works just as it should be build quality is good but not upto the mark signal reception is top notch cons camera quality is ok but low light it is terrible display has some tinting and banding issues battery life is average speaker quality is just garbage gets muffled on high volumes stock phone app including dailer sucks lack of headphone jack is really a serious issue for me it s allmost months old not any issues only some times it s sys when we use goole voice though net connection we have it says you don t have active internetdisplay is so nice and hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth camera is okay but not upto the mark macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap wide angle is okay but images are too smooth without any crispness fps video recording at k is not there at rear cam but is present for front cam don t know why they did that premium user experience face unlock and in display fingerprint is good phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame the signature slide button delivers the same good experience okay so if you feel that you need a g chipset and be future proof definitely go for it if you want a flagship perfomance go for k pro or oneplus t as this wont be a good choice for heavy users but still a good experience in regards of games for a short run cod in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops because it got an overclocked gpu stilli am satisfied with what i got here updated excellent charging speed thanks to warp charge to in less than an hour battery backup is so good for daily users lasts almost a day no serious heating issues at all this is a mid range phone one of the best and should not expect a monster perfomance from it one of the best choice as a daily driver if heavy perfomance is not your priority it is worst quality phone from oneplus i purchased nord for k and i had lot of problems with it and i sold it through olx for k display tint issue display is not good as other oneplus models network issue camera is terrible at most of the time i doubt that its ram is gb i had gb variant but it gives just a gb feel i m a big fan of oneplus that s why i bought it without looking for much reviews and i was cheated by oneplus so don t buy this phone guyz adhil malappuramkerala firstly one plus has make the customer fool during the oneplus nord ar launch of amount to all who purchased their launch event card about phone it is the most hyped phone which doesn t meet my expectations lack of mm headphone jack no dedicated micro sd card slot the mp and mp cameras are useless overall build quality is good oxygen os great android experience and future updates decent front and rear cameras the in display fingerprint scanner fast processor and above average display the battery is decent and supports fast charging very fast delivery received next day awesome phone first time i m trying oneplus never believe the negative comments and reviews of this gadget it s actually worth every penny u spend no mobile has much features like this does i m listing out the special features below super amoled display with inbuilt finger print scanner on display a solid phone with premium feel when bu use the first oneplus mobile to have the maximum number of cameras the first oneplus mobile to have selfie camera which could record k videos fps the first oneplus mobile to have the most advanced face unlock feature which can unlock even in deep darkness the first oneplus mobile to have a download speed of more than mbps ever recorded in okla india excellent gaming performance with no lags and delay in responsive frame rates with hdr support low resolution videos r more clear cameras outperform in ambient lighting conditions noise levels r high in low light conditions multi face recognition is inbuilt so group pictures r more illustrious oxygen os is way ahead than any other uis gigs of ram is the only milestone which u can t get at k below have used apps in the background and none restarted downloading is not a concern with nord other features include live captions horizon light screen gestures high resolution mode pro gaming modes game space aod feature finger print scanner is the fastest of all mobiles in this budget screen tint issue is an illusion never believe it blacks r deep ones etc fabulous experience a great deal at a given price for a premium product but the price charged should also meet the standards reviewing after month of usage few things important need to be tweaked by manufacturerbattery drains even if background apps were closed and phone is not in use or locked camera is not so great front camera takes long time to stabilize and capture at full clarity groupies cant be handled well with front camcharging takes around mins to get fully chargedstill some ui issues that really annoy such as no volume or vibration control for notifications with a notification light it would be somewhat useful nord doesn t have notification light it has internet wifi connectivity issues like sometimes notifications will receive when the phone is unlocked and whatsapp web wont connect properly if the phone is lockedfingerprint fingerprint recognition works fine but when you put it in pocket the pocket mode is not working properly and giving a notification as fingerprint disabled when we use i have been us this phone for a week now and here is my review the build quality is quite good but i don t like the plastic frame but feels durable enough look wise the phone is gorgeous and eye catchy i loved its look and in hand feel the rear camera is quite nice for the wide angle camera struggles in low light and the selfie camera is only good in well lighted conditions and is useless at night or even little dark i am not satisfied with selfie cam in low light the performance is average in heavy games but you won t notice any problems in day to day tasks the display is the best part about this phone the colours are punchy and gets plenty bright the hz refresh rate with the hz touch response is amazing and very smooth the single speaker is loud but not as good as dual speakers you will enjoy multimedia experience on this phone and the haptics are good too but feel a bit weak while typing the battery is average too it lasted me a day with hrs of usage without heavy games but it gets covered up with the fast charging of watts it only took mins from to overall i loved this phone but the selfie camera and macro camera needs improvements i ve been using this phone for weeks nowpros hz amoled display this is the cheapest device in market with an amoled hz screen oxygen os oneplus brandcons selfie camera even with beautification punches out extremely soft pictures they are so bad you can t even use them to post on social media taking group selfies with this phone is an embarrassment as photos are so bad that someone else would usually volunteer to take the picture i also installed bunch of other camera apps to remedy this failure including google camera but camera s hardware is in itself pathetic my poco f took much better pictures my friends including me expects better pictures from a oneplus brand but these images just completely ruins the brand oxygen os takes gb of storage i wanted to get the gb model but considering this and how in future updates os size will likely grow i had to shell out more for the gb model bad market practiceswhile every other brand is giving off amazing discounts oneplus didn t not only they didn t they disabled the hdfc discount for the gb variant of this device nord likely has much better profit margins than a lot of phones in the market we all know it s not a value but excluding your device variant from discounts is just bad nord lineup doesn t make sense at this price point oneplus should ve been selling their last year flagships near this price but instead they chose to release a worse product with likely better profit margins misleading ads hypegoing to oneplus nord website you ll see claims like flagship camera etc opening up the box you ll get a paper listing out what makes a smartphone great and how it is not always about specs all that marketing and yet the phone is extremely average conclusiononeplus nord is a fine phone it would ve made sense to launch this in western markets instead of in india we have much better options under k which makes this phone extremely over priced this is coming from a person who is not price sensitive i was actually looking to buy oneplus t awful colors though or samsung s amazing discounts this season but since i don t play games i thought i was taking a wise decision going with a company which knows it s not always about the specs oh boy i was so wrong in the end nord is an overpriced very average phone with a great display and a respected brand for now atleast got this nord in amazon pre order nord is absolutely a good choice for a best android experience and the gray onyx colour is so good than blue marble the hz display experience looks like a flagship the wide angle camera is best at its rate overall i m writing this review after months of use first i suspect that is this mobile of oneplus earlier i used oneplus so i know quality of touch pad after using this mob i believe that oneplus quality has gone down there are so many minus point back button left so this mobile is for lefty people don t purchas if you are right handed volume key also left and once you reduce same it couldn t be up steadily while watching video on full screen it s not possible to bring back back button for ahead programme you have to stop video first then you go ahead no more options for themes and wallpapers no earphone slot you have to purchase oneplus buds it cost approximately oneplus believe that customers are lefty other thing battery sound screen resolution ok i disappointed with quality of mob fingerprint key given on screen instead of back of mob if it is back side mob mab can be opened quick and easily im not satisfied with this mob after spending i advise not to purchase the same i was so excited to receive this mobile and utterly disappointed when the phone began hanging up and switching off and then automatically switching back on at random times sometimes when i was using it and sometimes when it lay untouched i have used one plus for years and my husband has used different mobiles of one plus series but we never had this experience needless to say we are utterly disappointed left with no option but to return it i upgraded from one plus t and it feel like i have done a blunder cons if you have like apps on your phone there will be a lag fingerprint and face detection takes ages to work phone is too bulky camera is much inferior battery lasts for less than one day it feels like this phone has a tag of one plus but underneath it it s just a cheap chinese product i must say one plus has lost its loyalist will never buy one plus from now pros affordable this is the only gb phone available in k fast charging i purchased this mobile on oct it is my rd one plus mobile earlier i used one plus two and one plus t also but the one plus g nord it is the worst phone of one plus mobile family it keep leaving network and also some app not working camera quality is also not that as good as one plus mobiles has in its products it is difficult to make or receive calls sometime this mobile is worst and a bad name to one plus family of mobiles please don t purchase this mobile disappointed with this model total waste of money if company really want to save the name they must take out or call back this product its nice dast phonegood qualitiescamera mp is greatdisplay nicesizeprocessorram managementcustomised navigate bar n settingscharger is too good makes full charge less than hr g hope come in then this phone be first to have it bad gb only storage no card slotcolors limitedvolume key on other side than normal other mobilesno mm jack nor they are providing converter so u have to buy wireless headset width of display is narrowuseless silent button it should be on some corner kind coz makes u confused for unlock buttonsingle speaker for sound makes it not goodif you are spending k then u should have some premium experience for that front camera is good but mp is not so goodover all its value for money for user experience n smoothness of screen n all review after months of usage daily usage beast my usage is restricted to calling social media small games and news app pro that actually matters loud and clear earpiece smooth os with fast face and fingerprint unlock day long battery with hours of usage mins charge and you re good to go camera has improved alot after os updates sleek design and light weightcons could have been a bit smaller in size for more handy usage sound is loud but quality should have been better yet to find anymore from day to day perspective after using years the battery of my moto x is suddenly stopped working after an ota update battery replacement was not possible during lockdown at the same time one plus announced to release a midrange smartphone like zlite one plus brand has great customer satisfaction regarding oxygen os optimization on hardware so i decided to purchase oneplus nord later declared with preorder benefits blindly purchase rs enjoyed ar launched event got my preorder box tshirt and stickers booked nord rs k using amex card my pre order is being delayed again oneplus announced that they will provide one year extra warrenty to those whose pre order shiioed after aug mine shipped on aug delivered on aug also they also provide my box rs and provide one year extra warrenty as they promised so at last faith on oneplus regarding products offers is totally worthy in this way effective price of my nord is k k amex offer gift box one year extended warranty right now i have updated my nord to i didn t face any problem just one google discover issue which may be issue with google dearch to higher refresh rate display no bluetooth issueno battery backup issue since i am not a gamer fabulous display with hzfast watt charger g g readybut have slightly tint screen issue using dark theme and very low brightness camera is overhyped may be optimised after ota update battery backup not at the best i m a oneplus fan still disappointed the green and magenta tint on display is very real whenever there is something grey on the screen which will be a lot if you use dark mode the display just goes crazy showing all tints from green to pink secondly there are some issues with google play services that doesn t load up a search or a page in one go but that might get fixed with ota cameras are a mixed bag if you take selfies soo much it sucks in indoor lighting conditions very good in outdoors but not indoors rest of the phone is what you would expect hz display you will forget after using it for a day and when u go back to hz it s not a discernable difference as every reviewer says so you will see difference b w nd hz but not so much here buy this only if you are looking for a oneplus phone otherwise there s better out there speed screen display tints in low brightness battery user interface oxygenos is the best no ads no nagware front camera in perfect lighting it would be in low lighting it would be back camera in perfect lighting it would be and in low lighting it would still be the night mode works like magic speakers mono but really loud they have sw optimizations that add the stereo effect in earphones build quality for plastic framedon t compare a k phone with flagship phones but i haved used my friend s oneplus pro and my nord together i didn t notice any difference at all the hz amoled display does the magic so smooth only when playing pubg in the highest settings the pro outperformed otherwise there is no noticeable issue also when it comes to the camera yes the mp mp sensors are crap the main sensor is good the mp wide angle is also good oneplus tweaks the software from time to time if you really want to use macro mode just click using the main sensor and then crop in the dedicated macro sensor is trash don t compare the nord with flagship phones sorry i do not generally write a critical review but this time i am doing it just to make other customers aware and i would urge all customers to spend few minutes in reading the reviews apart from specs the product is a waste of money the battery life drains too fast one cannot move with a big charger in workplace good option while work from home but a bad idea if you have long working hours or in travel camera is not up to the mark for its specifications sorry one plus nord i apologize but this product really disappointed me when i start using the phone i was really shockedand amazed by the touch screen smoothness and speed it s really too good one plus nord battery life is superb i had to go for once charging in a day if i am using the phone continuously watching gaming etc rather than mi note which had to go for charging twice camera quality at night is also superb finger print reader somewhat lagging in sensing sometime it is unable to read too fast removal of fingers etc i bought the oneplus phone first time and i bought gb gb varient of this phone i like every things on this smartphone like g ready camera oxygen os performance is mediocore the software of this device is best in the game i like it because it has the functionality like stock android and also highly customisable you can get software updates very quickly and fastly it s hz screen makes the experience more smooth and snappy i actually love photography so it is a very good phone to me it s camera have ois supported you can get very good daytime shots with it and may be mediocore night time shots but not as the level of flagship but this doesn t bother me because with the power of lightroom i can bring those photos to the another level the two things i didn t like that it s battery life it could be little bit better and also it s display have some little tint issue but that s not a big problem for me below are the attached sample shots from this device though it has a screen issue in low brightness but overall good device in low light if the screen brightness is set in low then there is a black bar through the camera cutout and also has slightly greenish tint but in regular usage it doesn t make any effect overall good battery in regular usage and performance is also good enough thanks to oxygen is for smooth experience nb cameras need more optimization and solve the screen issue though it has hz refresh rate but some times it lags need to fix this minor problems continuous loss of internet connectivity issue is most worst thing i noticed in this for example if your searching something on google it will show no internet connection and same thing i did with other phone using same connection it was working i was able to search and if your playing multiplayer games like asfalt or amoung us at that time you will face server issue and it was working in other phone same application using same network i think one plus need to fix this issue asp best phone under kgood battery life best display smooth touch rear front camera sound quality go for it very fast delivery with amazon prime in just days i received i am using jio as my primary network in my oneplus nord for a week most of the time there is a network problem the sim shows full network but net is not working properly i have to turn on to airplane mode and then turn off to get the network again please solve this issue i am getting this problem only in this phone screen very good amoled hz screen is a beauty very impressed with it camera images look very grainy in indoor photos can be easily fixed with software update using gcam for now day and night difference audio was not expecting that good sound but it has very good single speaker performance device not optimised for gaming this phone was having frame drops even in d games my previous k phone had less frame drop than this although graphics were better in this phone battery good enough battery not great software i had ordered this because of oos but in new update they have changed whole ui and it looks nothing like stock stock like ui was the reason i had ordered this i guess i have to rely on custom roms just like my last phone edit now after week i am completely disappointed with its performance too much frame drops even compared to sd g mobiles i m not talking about games like pubg or so it skips frame even in subway surf and too much frame skips in minecraft and angry birds transformer latter two are almost unplayable for me these games are not at all demanding and it still skips frames in those games terrible optimization i was not expecting great performance in demanding games but still it should be fine in less demanding games which it is notedit just installed call of duty surprisingly didnot experienced major framedrops they were there but i was looking for them otherwise smooth experience do not know why less demanding games like minecraft ans angry birds transformers have frame drop and this does not i did not buy this phone for games at highest setting but for smooth frame rate which it delivers in cod but in others fails to do so i purchase on th aug i am totally dissatisfied with one plus g nord one plus give updates in just one month why just because camera quality is not good sound quality is not good resolution is not good finger sensor is not good one plus should take back our phones as it have lots of manufacturing defects so they give updates in one month third class video call network problem don t waste your money in nord i request to one plus please replace your manufacturing defect mobile great battery life i have consistently been getting a full day s use on a single charge even hrs on one occasion where i used it sparingly and the battery charges to in under an hour display very good resolution the high refresh rate helps toosmooth app handling and multitasking even in my gb ram variantaudio very nice driver range and playback quality sounds perfectly good on good headphones and earphones this review comes out after using the device for about days and the performance is not good at all i have been using samsung huawei for so long and i didn t have any issues so far this is my first product from one plus and it s really something that everyone should think off this phone is really not worthy to spend touch response is not good sometimes it s stuck for a sec or few millisecs battery life if okay camera is good i bought oneplus nord last week which was delivered on th aug phone worked well for days and it stopped working on saturday night i found phone is turning off and on within secs on sunday morning and if it turns on and stays for a min then there would be no network it would neither connect to home wifi nor mobile network it hangs and turn offs immediately i contacted amazon for resolution and i was told to wait till wednesday a technician will come on wednesday to check whether phone is working is fine or not nothing can be done before that and there is no option to send tech early i have no other phone till and there is no guarantee when would i get refund or replacement of this product very pathetic service and will not recommend to anyone lovely phone people who are talking about bad camera quality must be shooting in auto mode the pro mode if handled properly works like a breeze n the picture quality is also fantastic n one always insatl gcam to improve camera performance yes the macro cam is useless n i think with few updates the auto mode will also work fine the display is vibrant its smpoth with hrz refresh rate the only thing that is bothering me is the in box back cover as i use gesture to navigate the phone the edge of the cover is too pronounced hence not been able to navigate smoothly waiting for other cool back cover options to hit the market oxygen os is in android mobile category plus phone specification and design are just like cherry on the cake if you are switching to nord from any miui os device you would definitely going to have a roller coaster ride but still oxygen os need improvement as compare to miui in areas like gallary display file manager options and some inbuilt apps are missing like qr code scanner no compass ir blaster are missing no memory card slot etc etc seh lenge still i will recommend you buy this as these cons are just whereas pros are waiting for you so definitly go for this beast overall i m happy with the way this phone performs lets point its features out great display fells extremely smooth thanks to its hz refresh rate colors are punchy on the phone and a bit on the contrasty side by default but you can change it to your liking anyway performance is great g is more than enough for a lite user and by this i don t mean it won t perform if you want to play a few games on it works beautifully now the only issue i came across while using this phone was its camera even though it s being advertised for its bomb camera setup it s really not that special the camera struggles quite a bit under low light or even a well lit indoor shot this said i am pretty sure this will improve over time as this phone has the hardware to get those beautiful shots so its just a matter of time before oneplus comes up with a few updates and fixes all these issue well at least i hope they do so to summarize overall this phone is great and will satisfy your needs and expectations just dont think the same for its camera that s just poor i just received the product today but since it is not deliverable in my place had to order it to my friends uncles house and had to collect from there when i collected the package the seal was broken i juz wanted to know if anything extra comes in the amazon box other than the nord box rest i will update about the product after using it for a few days its been a week since i am using the phone it is awesome i am very happy with it i was using one plus and now changed to nord camera quality is awesome even in low light battery backup for a person like me who does most of his work over the phone is awesome i charge it once everyday smooth functioning and i love the new marble blue colour i have used ash and onyx but like this colour so overall a good phone came in good condition well packed thank u amazon i suggestion not to buy if your luck doesn t favours you you face the problems mentioned below over rated hard ware specunder quality software phone gets auto reboot looses data and coming to camera there is a lag you get the click sound but the later moment is getting captured when using camera phone gets heated up called customer care about these issue they recommend factory reset but in vain being oneplus user from oneplus expected lot from this mobile nord in hand doesn t give that premium experience that u get from rest oneplus mobiles oneplus series is the last premium mobile from op one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust this is really a overpriced don t go on brand name and look now a days samsung is very strong with their midrange mobiles camera is literally bad i mean really really bad if you are a selfie lover please don t go with this cpu is slower compared to current flagships camera s for depth and macro photos especially mp macro lens giving poor quality output not suggestable for users who prefer heavy gaming like pubg sound quality is borrowed from cheap china mobile not expected from oneplus average touch response though it offers amoled screen and hz refresh rate problems in reflecting actual network signal strength i have been using this phone since week now and below are my findings pros oxygen os experience its fluid and smooth i already got updates in one week excellent display camera ois and nightscape mode is too good the depth and macro camera is of no use main selfie camera is good body design is good phone feels premium and easy to hold fast charging it charges the phone from to in around mins gaming is smooth without any lag i played pubg ball pool and bully anniversary edition cons i thing the battery life is average maybe the hz screen is draining it quickly i am getting day of backup with moderate usage all in all i think this is a good purchase there maybe other brands that are offering better on paper specs in this price but remember the main usp of this device is the experience of using oxygen operating system super phone in this time this rang all in one in oneplus nord pros oxygen os which runs as smooth as expected amoled screen and hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage sound quality is good and modestly loud drawback in cons the design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth and a bit more on length all the more better viewing experience gaming performance is average similar phones in this range have better gaming performances the phone looks and feels premium while using the alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes face unlock is as fast as other oneplus phones very very fast cons the camera is not as good as it was expected the macro lens is pretty useless and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren t as vibrant as oneplus a bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots k video recording fps is absent but fps performance is quite good the camera is better than most phones out there but it isn t what we were promised no headphone jack the mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone which tends to get covered by your hand while using also being on just one side of the phone the audio isn t as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker no expandable memory slot the plastic frame doesn t look like plastic but it is is a worrying thing and makes the phone comparatively less durable fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn t as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back i am using dual sims after every hours outgoing and incoming call facility is not working although there is full network then i had switch on the aeroplane mode and off the same to enable the calls if you are thinking of one plus nord then don t think and compare with other phones it s doesn t make sense to buy nord by buying this mobile i have lost image on even k mobiles have better camera than this all camera s are useless just to have grainy pics back body is plastic also have heating issues if think of replacement which will never happen so forget about replacement big no for nord i am one plus user since and bought this phone after a lot of reviews and a months wait no reviewer absolutely no one pointed out the very fact that with great power comes great responsibility if you ask me features i cant say they are any less than expected i am not fond of photography neither of heavy gaming but i do require heavy multitasking good network seamless performance in day to day basis good battery and clean os but this phone has all of them more than what you will ask it houses the same modem that op op pro has same camera hardware as op almost similar os special mention for network and data speeds it has lte advanced with several additional capacities and absolutely flawless network screen on time hrs consistent and charging is flawless battery drain is more during hotspot or mobile data charger doesn t heat the phone but processing doesbut only drawback is snapdragon it is by far highly weak for all of these it cant handle it for long and heats up too much even knowing this the manufacturer has adopted different cooling systems like copper heat desiccator on cpu camera even at screen but of no help i experienced heavy temperature up to degrees on normal usage and on min video gaming also heats up equally even op customer care agrees degrees damages cpu story of return something you should be aware ofi dint order return till th day in all these days i contacted amazon cc and oneplus cc followed their suggestions wiping out cache testing in safe mode factory reset etc followed min max theory of battery chargingon th day when i ordered return i understood few conditions of days return warranty it saysitem received is physically damaged you should report in first hrs item received has missing parts or accessories item received is different from their description on the product detail page on amazon in oritem received is defective does not work properly now its the last case for mine but its highly subjective who will determine thisamazon has a technician who will visit and inspect who are they they are third party engaged by amazon the first visit fellow from trouble shooting this fellow calls me at th hour half hour before service needs to be completed as per schedule he says he will come in few minutes and ask me some details after few hours i find my service is completed what is the report my phone is working fine and no issues that should make it non eligible for return that is where amazon comes to rescue they listened to my issue and arranged another senior technician also share that the only technicians report is not everything by the time i already have temperature screen shots i shared these with the second technician and he agrees to item received is defective does not work properly thankfully my phone return in picked up and money credited back thanks to amazon and i ordered my other phone off course not nord from amazon so these are few words of caution from opening up the box to setting it up and using it oneplus nord provided a delightful experience be it in terms of the fluidity or performance as expected from oneplus it was a breeze to update the os apps and the ux was top notch warp charge t worked as advertised topping up the phone pretty quickly the camera performance was decent although oneplus should have skipped on the gimmic of numbers and gone with just two good ones at the back in my limited testing for two days battery life was above average netting me hours of screen on time with location and auto brightness on using only social networking apps and light games this is bound to get better as the phone learns your usage habits and accomodates accordingly the most unfortunate part was quality control for the display a pink tint that covered about of the right side of nord s display under brightness it was terrible and noticable even inside a well lit room provided the screen was under brightness this forced me to return this otherwise lovely phone as it was a deal breaker i d still like to place orders in future to try my luck in what seems like a display lottery as the phone experience is rather well balanced it s a recommended purchase provided you get one with a good display otherwise return it camera quality of oneplus nord is good for daylight and night battery life is also quite good and charging speed is so fast but i think that it s a good option to consider on budget with stock android bloatware free os and finally it s g phone so we can use it for future jio g for more information about camera review watch my video on iprotechhub i am writing the review after using for months camera picture quality is very good during day and night charging is very fast almost full in min phone does not heatup during normal use or light games all heavy games playing smoothly even now only dissappintment is that during summer when outside temperature is more than c degree camera stop working due to over heating even normal use is dangourus since mobile gets too hot phone does not have ip water resistant rating missed to check while buying which should be there in k rs cost best phone full reviewdisplay butter smoothno tint issue in my phone not even battery gives hours of screen on time on hz displayeasily completes more than a day with normal to medium useno heating issuefull charge in mins from camera best for video recording k with rear cam too with gcam hope we get it in stock camera after update photos from rear camera are good enough front cam is also above average and really good with gcamnight scape just awesome sharp and good quality imagesand phone also handle high quality video while editing and renderingin hand feel awesome compactno connectivity issue network wifi no issue with data speedoxygen os well optimized do not buy this mobile at all this mobile s camera is very bad and the android update is the worst the cameras of this mobile specially so called macro are useless the google chrome also not working in this mobile the worst funny part of this mobile is when you starting and stoping to record a call then software will inform about that action by voice message i mean what the hell is this if i am want to record a call that means that is secret and your software inform that person about that finger print reader is very slow i was so sceptical believe me after reading so many reviews about this and that i was really sacred as to what i ll end up receiving but thankfully i got a beautifully sealed secured new phone as for the device i like it it has everything you need obviously you can t expect the things you get in a k s phone the camera is pretty cool irrespective of what some people say i find it amusing i am not a professional photographer but i do love to capture images i ve attached some for ref battery life is awesome finger print reader face unlock is workable haptics and other features are great the built quality is durable just be careful with the sim ejector i scratched my phone xd this was truly an upgrade for me someone who s coming from an unnamed brand s smartphone and yes no need to buy a cover or screen guard it comes with it easy to set up and a very compact device the phone is good and definitely feels premium and in day to day life performance is as smooth as butter and camera is good though can be improved with system updates and the warp charge is consistent and charges the phone from to in over an hour depending on the voltage you receive overall a pretty sweet phone with good built quality it does not matter much that the frame is plastic afterall you are going to protect it with a case at the end of the day only thing that is lacking is the camera a little bit but that can be improved with updates otherwise i am satisfied with my purchase and it is a phone which is overall a very good device with good haptic feedback topnotch indisplay fingerprint sensor etc talking about the tint issue this can be solved with software update and hope that oneplus would look into this issue and resolve it as soon as possible with a software update camera quality is very disappointing even samsung s below k models will take good photos don t get trapped by their hypes gimmicks pls do watch geekayranjith s detailed review video before you order it worst thing is depth camera is fake it s useless if u want to own oneplus go for other good models don t go for nord instead buying it for k u can prefer other brands with better overall performance under k got the device after a month of launch nord is not as per expectations battery life is horrible i need to charge my device twice a day no doubt it gets only hour to charge but battery back up is hour is hudge disappointing camera is not as per oneplus know for it is average like mid budget k device has micro camera is just to add numbers night mode is also not so great it has google dialpad you can t auto record calls and even if you does after it keep alerting during call you re call has been recorded only good thing is no ads oxygen os i ll never suggest to invest this much amount for average phone just because of brand name worst phone by one plus the front camera is worse than realme x the phone has too much software problems if anyone is buying it remember you cannot return this item even if there is return policy i have conversation with the amazon assistant but they doesn t took the phone back i told them i will buy the upgraded phone oneplus t but they didn t took the phone back my worst experience in amazon this is the best phone one can buy within a budget of k i was pretty much confused at first as there were many negative reviews about the nord but finally i decided to buy the gb variant and all i can say is it s completely worth it as i wanted a phone for multimedia purpose which requires good camera good resolution in display smooth performance the nord completely meets my expectation battery could have been a lil bit better but also don t forget that the device runs in a hz refreshing rate which can be reduced to hz as well for longer lasting of the battery and the warp charger is great too charges from in around mins which is quite good i suppose people saying it s a over hyped phone it ain t other brands are jealous of oneplus the way they are capturing the market go for it without a second thought you won t regret this is one of the best phones from oneplus buf with some fixable flaws i m using a gb ram variant and not at all happy with the oxygen os s ram management even though my phone has gigs it cannot keep more than apps running in background and no app running in background after min so just forget about heavy games which is not expected from oneplus and that too from a gigs variant i know keeping apps running in ram could drain the battery but let the users decide it another thing is camera seriously macro lense sucks and is waste of space waste of money waste of time camera app needs a software update output images are not as great and consistent as from oneplus even though oneplus s is claiming same module well mentioned issues can get solved in future updates display is awesome but even my handset has that greenish shade issues when seeing at screen in very dark room which isn t a big deal if you re switching from a series chip then you ll definitely see the performance difference but hz covers it smartly everyone is saying battery is great but i didn t get more than hours of sot that too without gaming final call is yours cheers p s you can not uninstall the pre installed netflix app when comparing with t camera quality is worst battery day times have to charge on call connection with wifi battery drains min percent always keep an eye on battery other china make is far better with mi vivi oneplus for waste of moneyslowly phone is getting slower display problem well what do you know after much anticipation i finally received my oneplus nord thanks to amazon for striving to deliver even during these trying times without much further ado lets get down to the nitty gritty as am not much into writing reviews first of all gave only three stars as it is kinda hit and miss battery is ok with average usage but heavy users will be disappointed wrap charge does a wonderful job as described and charges the device really fast camera is so so mp takes good shots but that s about it as the rest is average at best macro is the worst finger print scanner and face unlock works just fine had no issues with display videos are crisp youtube and netflix videos especially hdr contents are a joy to watch wifi and internet connectivity is good especiall with dual connect microphone quality is ok and cell reception is also good thats the ok part now comes some of the bad part as in the headlines there are some serious issues with bluetooth connectivity all bluetooth devices you name it fit bit audio etc etc gets disconneted frequently as well as sometimes it is a pain to pair sometimes not pairing at all have tried the bluetooth devices in other phones and laptop and they work just fine why am i making this a big thing because one plus did not include a headphone jack period and i love listening to music i dont know whether this is a software or hardware issue have installed the latest updates so will have to wait for the next update to know whether it will get corrected or not the speakers on the phone are mediocrewill update after using it for a month or so hopefully my impression of the device will change keeping fingers crossed now you choose whether to buy or not as there are other good phones out there overall performance is good not excellent update bluetooth issues solved with updates amazed at oneplus frequent updates camera performing much better now have been using the phone for about a month now stars oneplus nord is definitely overhyped to the next level but the price is good and it is not the best oneplus device nowhere near oneplus camera is the weakest point the third camera for the bokeh mode is not even used when you hide the third camera and click on portrait mode of the picture quality is still the same if you have no problem with camera go for it or increase your budget and go for oneplus overall it s a decent phone it is not a flagship if you want that experience it is a really good midrange experience coming from one of the better brands you can certainly get more value for money from other brands however the quality of software support and customer service from oneplus is better than all such brands a must buy especially if you love oxygen os or just want a reliable device to use for years unlike what oneplus had profoundly mentioned in their amazon portfolio the camera is anything but flagship mp macro is a joke of the year primary cam takes sharp photos under broad daylight but lacks depth under low light conditions it just gives up about selfie cam don t even get me started overall all six cameras suck processor is fast but there are faster ones in the market within the bugdet so gamers don t invest here battery lasts a day on medium usage if you are a heavy user don t buy this phone hz refresh rate drains battery even faster wanderlusters please keep the charger and an electric socket handy recharging is quick very quick fingerprint reader is fast if not superfast like those physical ones so unless you are stupid refrain from comparison oxygen os in one word awesome this was one of the major reasons why i purchased this phone bloatware free ui is something i had craved for i hated those unsolicited ads on xiaomis and oppos and honors et al also a near flagship from samsung or apple was out of question as i like my kidneys more long story short touch look and feel is premium great ui however if you are into photography gaming wired music maniac i own a tws so don t really care or really tight on budget don t get this phone rest choice is yours the media could not be loaded i bought mobile on th august it s been approx months now and my mobile oneplus nord gb gb is sent to service centre on th oct i was on teams audio call for around hours in the afternoon and i got sensor alert of high heat i thought it is because i was roaming on my balcony with sunlight on it i came in after alert everything was ok and suddenly at around pm in the night when i was using whatsapp mobile screen went completly yellow with no visibility and finger print sensor stopped working restarted times but things went bad i did not expect new launch and as a trusted brand prelaunch buyer i should have faced this issue looks like inbuilt quality and electronics used inside are of very poor quality and my mobile does not have even a single scratch on it watch video i tried to check by peeling scratch guard also from corners disclaimer i am typing this from my c pro which has broken glass for last years and kept it as my back up mobile and still it s visibility is very clear i have shown this comparison to courier guy who collected my mobile to repair center there is no issue in display bottom speaker work well no issue performance awesomeside plastic ring is looking like cheap material pre applied screen protector also back cover only missing in box usb type c heandfree otherwise put mm jackaverage front camera such a cheap product from one plus brandphone is faulty and they dnt have a service center in my city instead of replacing they are asking me to visit the service center which is in another city this is insane why to ship to city which has no service centres just grabbing customers money zero service from amazon and one plus amazon simply pushing it to one plus it s not for the first time that one plus had made any undoubtedly price worthy smart phones i was using one plus since last years and was thinking to upgrade it so finally made my decision to buy so finally made my hunt for new phone initially when i searched for reviews about one plus nord people have very mixed reviews which made my purchase difficult i thought wether i should go or not but finally made my mind and bought this and i am really happy and it s totally vfm pros fingerprint reader is awesome mobile support s dual sim g g sim camera quality is average mobile ram storage size is excellent battery life is average mobile highlight s mobile ram size gb mobile storage gb mobile support s dual sim g g sim fingerprint reader is awesome mah lithium ion battery camera front mp mpfront dual camera with k video capture camera back mp mp mp mp qued rear camera cons camera mp are less compare to other brands compare to other brands oneplus nord model has less features mobile is very expensive over all good product but not up to the mark today i got the mobile delivery was delay for one day received all in good condition just one look it great from outside pros continue used hour its little bit heat i dont know why its happening front camera not as reality pic it seems to add some filter app there is no audio jack or rear camera quality also not too much good as expected before battery drain used hour continue cons screen is very good as faster fingerprint face sensor very quick fast charging its look slim phone as compared to other mobile like redmi oppo vivo etc go for it in this budget will be update the reviews after using few days if you wana purchase oneplus nord then go for it its great phone in this budget display quality is not as good coming from the oneplus the amoled of oneplus is far better color is not same and saturation is also not good i think it s really cheap display i didn t notice any green tint issue overall phone is good camera quality is good built is also good lot of bluetooth issues bluetooth connection is unstable and noisy so cannot use bluetooth headphone this phone does not have audio jack either so no way we can use headphone this bt issue is persisting even after multiple os updates pushed by oneplus got this about years back to replace a one plus pros decent screen comes with hz refresh rate a feature my iphone xr lacks colors and resolution are also good speedy it is still super fast to use months later fast charging love the fast charging capability bundled charger build quality fair doesn t feel cheap g it came with a tech that still isn t available to use but brownie points for future proofing fingerprint reader quick and works without issuecons cameras they are simply sub par not much to be said here if you need good cameras please look elsewhere be it front or rear camera either are not comparable to flagship phones years old battery life could be better auto brightness hate the auto brightness settings on this simply doesn t work well not sure if it s a cheap brightness sensor or software dislikes i dint like the seller experience while placing the order i placed the order on th aug and item was supposed to get delivered on th aug however the seller dint dispatch the order till friday and then the delivery date got changed to nd sep seller was unresponsive and dint respond to the email very bad service though i received the product on nd but i never expected this kind of overall service by amazon likes phone is simply awesome this is my second buy from one plus first one was one plus t in simple words i really loved the phone the grey one looks really nice though the back panel is plastic made but they have made it look very nice good one well one thing which i dont like about the new one plus models is the wire jack we need to use a connector rest all good i guess the one plus lite model will have that wire jack feature positive good display and touch pink tint issue is there but it will not hamper your experience decent sound on both speaker and earphones main camera mp is good brilliant ram management no lag observed in normal usage satisfactory battery life and fast charging works perfectly no heating issue observed during normal usage and fast charging finger print and face unlock works perfectly wifi and bluetooth connectivity is good enough and the call quality is also pretty much standard blue colour is really good and weight distribution is great in hand feeling is good the clean and add free ui of the oxigen os will make it way different from other android phone of this budget back cover is really good no complain on the pre applied screen guard haptic feedback motor is just okaynegative below standard camera performance at low light selfie camera is not that sharp or good slow image processing noticed software optimization required oneplus could provide a telephoto lense instead of giving those bad depth and macro lenses hz display is not as smooth as i expected software optimization is required auto brightness could have been work more smoothly jarking noticed when the brightness is getting increase or decrease again the software optimization required mm jack is not there at least the type c converter must be included in the box sometime noticed the screen gets tapped when the fingers are extremely close to the screen verdict good for a reliable daily driver but probably the gaming experience will not be immersive g has no use the device could be configured with sd g chipset since the performance is pretty much similar to the g based devices price could be reduced atleast upto k by using the g processor balanced device this device has no extraordinary feature and has nothing extemely bad gb variant is the best value for money option over hyped and little over priced only go for it if you like oneplus and it s clean ui phone is good looking and handy feels like a premium phone camera is awesome and must buy phone under more fully it doesn t feel more weight and feels really weightless one and warp charge also does its job quickly and when my phone is at while you charge it shows to minutes to get fully charged phone doesn t get heat while charging including charge holder bought a phone all over performance is good but unsatisfied with battery as i am charging my phone twice a day and when i am trying to replace the phone technical team of amazon just test my battery online by blancco app and said its not as per our term s and conditions as your battert is working good but i am using phone since days and daily charging my phone twice a day and i have not a single game in my phone unsatisfied with battery performance and policy of amazon no tint issuei turned ont he phone they gave me an update so typically your phone brightness level levelthey palyed it smart they removed levelsso technically when u slide to the left end on the brightness tab to reduce ur brightness thinking it would go to well it s actually th level portraying as my first costly smart phone well for average person i mostly invest under k for a smart phone now i m in work from home and i need a phone which has a fast performance to toggle between apps for my communication multitasking without any lagging or unwanted adds and ya bla bla people who worship camera as if they are ravi varmans cousin s guys this phone is literally a mustang coated in ferrari dust hard build even though claims to be plastic body a devil performance which u can expect from no android phone yes fast charging helps us stay alive it has a open allow access system which i like so that i can monitor which app is using my phone tools when smart phone concept came to the marked i started with samsung galaxy pop moved to moto g then redmi now it s nord i bought it k by exchanging my redmi a decent buy for me rating back camera front camera because pics look slightly animatedperformance battery you can expext hrs max but fast charging helps u in mins charge sets full battery design durability no ip certification so try to avoid water drops and dust touching the device people buying this in chennai remember only one service center available tnagar i recommend you to use the back case given buy them it s durabale nord shows camera lens and two of those bottom are fake top lens might be for face detection only one lens actually is used as capturing photo very disappointed even amazon is playing along in this scam now that is the reason recent nord is launched with only two camera lens had seen a video in youtube in which a guy remove the nord lens and shows the bottom two lens are fake oneplus finally achieved in fraud activities i paid k for this fake camera phone one plus brand is now a fake brand on goin latest design also will get more fake options and conduct more fraud i will not ever recommend oneplus to any if this is not posted here i shall post on my social platform with video it s best product oneplus is a brand and nord is a new direction camera quality is better but not as good as and battery life is quite good and it s charges min to it gaves the best performance and here is hrtz refresh rate then it s best but if u used htz refresh rate phone then u will see definitely the difference face unlock is so fast but fingerprint scanner is not so good and amoled display is the best u must need to but this product and now new direction comes in my life i m happy to get it '"
